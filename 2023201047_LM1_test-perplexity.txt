Mr Wickhams happiness and her own was per force delayed a little longer and Mr Collinss proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could	71.09709432312432
Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life every body had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to Miss Bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful	8.778013135972484
I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get home and see if I can make it up any better And when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unconcern Oh	22.456979955397745
and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule And this cried Darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me	32.74549162877729
They have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression	1333.521432163324
I have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children Not that I have much pleasure indeed in talking to any body	187.38174228603845
A man of honour could not have doubted the intention but Mr Darcy chose to doubt it or to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudence in short any thing or nothing	11.583232862547103
My aunts intelligence had given me hope and I was determined at once to know every thing Lady Catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use	20.691380811147894
In a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour	121.15276586285881
blushed and Jane blushed but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour	316.227766016838
Had she merely with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together and four evenings may do a great deal Yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt un better than Commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic I do not imagine that much has been unfolded Well said Charlotte I wish Jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him to morrow I should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth	2.7213387683753076
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas	1351.1673854629069
This was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming	316.227766016838
Let me hear what it is We are speaking of music Madam said he when no longer able to avoid a reply	149.24955450518294
When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring any thing you had a fancy for These are home questions and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature	15.505157798326243
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side	5.575305334261898
Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to Mrs Bennet They had several children	100.00000000000001
E	1.2848575558448747
Once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear	599.4842503189408
Lady Catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts	1333.521432163324
And their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she should be able to shew her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the North	52.983169062837085
I have told Miss Bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though Mrs Collins has no instrument she is very welcome as I have often told her to come to Rosings every day and play on the piano forte in Mrs Jenkinsons room	9.152473108773892
The day of his and Lydias departure soon came and Mrs Bennet was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth	12.91549665014884
As soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all their boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of Kittys and Lydias purchases were seated in it	14.547578108480476
The business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news	599.4842503189408
Illustration A VICARAGE HOUSE PRIDE AND PREJUDICE A Novel	2009.3990367086515
Good gracious	1.284857555844875
He observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added It is above eight months	9.152473108773892
I will answer for it he never cared three straws about her	5346.783134922081
Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas for Mr Collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton	26.826957952797255
In this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away	3727.5937203149383
Her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business	17.782794100389232
I cannot do justice to his kindness	898.9241878992768
In his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told Elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting Mr Collins to join his daughters in their walk and Mr Collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely well pleased to close his large book and go	3.874675120456131
Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement took place	4898.878950229736
When this information was given and they had all taken their seats Mr Collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification but when Mrs Philips understood from him what Rosings was and who was its proprietor when she had listened to the description of only one of Lady Catherines drawing rooms and found that the chimney piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeepers room	2.493592004984159
I am quite well	75.62753249048197
Such a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but gratitude for to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined	9.152473108773892
She could think only of her letter	954.8622169161257
Her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered	3228.475297332962
He was received by Mrs Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend	26.826957952797255
He heard her with astonishment	240.91188461952237
She looked at her father to entreat his interference lest Mary should be singing all night	873.3261623828432
I know you will contrive it all But Mr Gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fears and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on table they left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters	5.179474679231211
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other	71.09709432312432
Mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance	10.0
And what sort of table do they keep	1489.1627601779014
But I knew not I was afraid of doing too much	3615.0178056337836
Elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known Sir Williams too long	3829.76906463376
As for your Elizabeths picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes It would not be easy indeed to catch their expression but their colour and shape and the eye lashes so remarkably fine might be copied At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs Hurst and Elizabeth herself	6.042963902381328
Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr Darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for Mr Hurst by whom Elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her	8.11130830789687
The tête à tête surprised them	564.9677109337
Mr Darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public	3670.798197728764
They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother	3228.475297332962
Younger sons cannot marry where they like Unless where they like women of fortune which I think they very often do Our habits of expence make us too dependant and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money Is this thought Elizabeth meant for me and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone And pray what is the usual price of an Earls younger son	4.003221666659723
His behaviour to myself has been scandalous but I verily believe I could forgive him any thing and every thing rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase and listened with all her heart but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry	7.813707376518094
They must have seen them together for ever Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on Lydias side but nothing to give him any alarm	41.011270705513006
Who about such a nasty little freckled thing Elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such coarseness of herself the coarseness of the was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal	19.14481976169958
I am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him	428.1332398719392
Her affections had been continually fluctuating but never without an object	4341.218347705809
It cannot last long	97.91709669801119
Perhaps I am not doing her justice	795.0070812637317
came on into Hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in Barnet and Hatfield but without any success no such people had been seen to pass through	32.74549162877729
Your mother must have been quite a slave to your education Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she assured her that had not been the case	71.09709432312432
It is highly improper	97.91709669801119
He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation Mr Hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingleys salutation	29.552092352028872
The pain of separation however might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his next return into Hertfordshire the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men	11.006941712522094
But will they make you happy Have you any other objection said Elizabeth than your belief of my indifference None at all	149.24955450518294
You have done all this	264.0029742293326
I have not pain	60.147142942041945
Did you see it Bingley replied that he did and made his congratulations	3727.5937203149383
In the afternoon the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an hour by themselves and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which Jane was equally eager to satisfy	20.691380811147894
Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first	240.40991835099712

Had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw Mr Darcy the gardeners expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it	14.547578108480476

They descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehensions of meeting its owner returned	46.415888336127786

We may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon	316.227766016838

Sir William did not say much	495.69628172386786
You have widely mistaken my character if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these	316.227766016838
And you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner Kitty who took all these threats in a serious light began to cry	17.782794100389232
She had ventured only one glance at Darcy	1760.060344050462
The envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hot pressed paper well covered with a ladys fair flowing hand and Elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages	17.782794100389232
To Rosings he then hastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter and on his return brought back with great satisfaction a message from her Ladyship importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her	11.006941712522094
Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness And with these words he hastily left the room and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house	12.216773489967919

That had his actions been what Wickham represented them so gross a violation of every thing right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as Mr Bingley was incomprehensible	12.91549665014884
I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat	3727.5937203149383

There are few people in England I suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste	149.24955450518294
She talked to Elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turns	3727.5937203149383
Pray read on After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match	6.601948484081891
Now what have you to say Only this that if he is so you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment and then replied The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind	12.216773489967919
But I will no longer importune my young cousin Then turning to Mr Bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon	149.24955450518294
I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning	873.3261623828432
The two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation	32.74549162877729

The bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough and Wickham who happened to sit near Elizabeth began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies	13.68874509537081

And since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt but I hope this may be false Oh Jane had we been less secret had we told what we knew of him this could not have happened Perhaps it would have been better replied her sister	8.11130830789687
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour	873.3261623828432
You will only think I feel than I ought to do when I tell you all What do you mean Why I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley	29.552092352028872
Of what he has accused me I am ignorant but of the truth of what I shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity	52.983169062837085
Such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them	46.415888336127786
If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at Netherfield said Mrs Bennet to her husband and all the others equally well married I shall have nothing to wish for In a few days Mr Bingley returned Mr Bennets visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library	8.431909292866257
Very well That reply will do for the present Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones But we may be silent Do you talk by rule then while you are dancing Sometimes	15.505157798326243
I shall offer to pay him to morrow he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading Mr Collinss letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to go saying as she quitted the room If any young men come for Mary or Kitty send them in for I am quite at leisure Elizabeths mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hours quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure	2.821307675939472
Mrs Collins you must send a servant with them	2141.953885092933
On this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared	10.481131341546856
She was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more It now first struck her that was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at Rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors	7.813707376518094
There is nothing extravagant in housekeeping I dare say No nothing at all A great deal of good management depend upon it	149.24955450518294
But it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted	873.3261623828432
The very mention of any thing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of	46.415888336127786
Had she not seen him in Derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to Jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there his friends permission or being bold enough to come without it	7.813707376518094
want to tell me and I have no objection to hearing it This was invitation enough	873.3261623828432
Till this moment I never knew myself From herself to Jane from Jane to Bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr Darcys explanation had appeared very insufficient and she read it again	16.57723885589317
You have insulted me in every possible method	1537.8209446592753
In comparing her recollection of Pemberley with the minute description which Wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself	24.484367468222267
He begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the good natured gossiping Lucases	52.983169062837085
It had not been very great he had lost every point but when Mrs Philips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged she would not make herself uneasy	8.431909292866257
Poor little Lizzy	19.280007499081826
After sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in London Mr Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself	6.40400427119728
It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations	428.1332398719392
Her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all the others	1333.521432163324

She had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome	240.40991835099712
Elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyships entrance though no request of introduction had been made	240.40991835099712
She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration the shocking rudeness of Mr Darcy	61.05402296585327
Mr Collins might never make the offer and till he did it was useless to quarrel about him	428.1332398719392

She could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man	52.983169062837085
I cannot acquit him of that duty nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards any body connected with the family And with a bow to Mr Darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room Many stared Many smiled but no one looked more amused than Mr Bennet himself while his wife seriously commended Mr Collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a half whisper to Lady Lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man	3.0579958606136803

Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites It may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey	3.1622776601683795

CHAPTER IX	1.284857555844875
I mend pens remarkably well Thank you but I always mend my own How can you contrive to write so even He was silent	100.00000000000001
They had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when Bingleys quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room	9.152473108773892
Compliments always take by surprise and never	1046.3393929311092
Though Darcy could never receive at Pemberley yet for Elizabeths sake he assisted him farther in his profession	428.1332398719392
More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the Park unexpectedly meet Mr Darcy She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers How it could occur a second time therefore was very odd Yet it did and even a third	4.738879609717654
I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice	599.4842503189408
Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with I hope Mr Bingley will like it Lizzy We are not in a way to know Mr Bingley likes said her mother resentfully since we are not to visit But you forget mama said Elizabeth that we shall meet him at the assemblies and that Mrs Long has promised to introduce him I do not believe Mrs Long will do any such thing	4.3754793750741845
They could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit	316.227766016838
Lady Lucas herself has often said so and envied me Janes beauty	5346.783134922081
It could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice a sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself	14.547578108480476
Mrs Hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently Mr Darcys eyes were fixed on her	19.14481976169958
She has known him only a fortnight	1120.6900652727268
Mrs Gardiner who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth gave her a look expressive of her wonder	428.1332398719392
Their powers of conversation were considerable	627.2367209905697
After a short pause her companion added You are too generous to trifle with me	1333.521432163324
Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal	187.38174228603845
Well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home	599.4842503189408
He has made me so happy said she one evening by telling me that he was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring	83.76776400682921
Very few days passed in which Mr Collins did not walk to Rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours	8.431909292866257
I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them I am not now to learn replied Mr Collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time	4.216965034285823
It has been a very agreeable day said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth	4461.689139256896
You dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each other of exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind She paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse	4.216965034285823
I hope we may often meet again Elizabeth smiled	2362.9358734847483
In a short time I shall have a daughter married	2545.9926606609447
Kitty and Lydia take his defection much more to heart than I do	3727.5937203149383
He was then he said on his way to Longbourn on purpose to inquire after her	873.3261623828432
To the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantle piece the interval of waiting appeared very long	15.505157798326243
Conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none	240.40991835099712
gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna Green something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W	187.38174228603845
She got up and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour	83.76776400682921
This was one point with regard to Lydia at least which was now to be settled and Mr Bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him	41.011270705513006
Oh Jane take care My dear Lizzy you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday and Mrs Bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley in half an hours visit had revived	4.3754793750741845
Mr Jones says we must not think of moving her	3194.4674919357367
Her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved	627.2367209905697
Mr Bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required	121.15276586285881
Oh Lydia I comfort myself with thinking replied Jane that he certainly would not marry Lydia if he had not a real regard for her	83.76776400682921
Bingley was ready Georgiana was eager and Darcy determined to be pleased	5079.894397423908
no I can much more easily believe Mr Bingleys being imposed on than that Mr Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts every thing mentioned without ceremony If it be not so let Mr Darcy contradict it	11.583232862547103
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees	41.011270705513006
The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could be	187.38174228603845
Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly	1120.6900652727268
This is an evening of wonders indeed	1046.3393929311092
Do not let us quarrel about the past	1655.8735216287728
In a doleful voice Mrs Bennet thus began the projected conversation Oh	5346.783134922081
The house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and Lady Catherines behaviour was most friendly and obliging	240.40991835099712
It is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time Mr Bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me	20.691380811147894
Two offences of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge	187.38174228603845
Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind	1557.854041141138
Every kind of pride must revolt from the connection	2390.6215493862082
CHAPTER XIX	1.284857555844875
Mr Wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia	149.24955450518294
I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished Your list of the common extent of accomplishments said Darcy has too much truth	10.481131341546856
I shall go distracted This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and Elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away	36.51741272548377
At such an assembly as this it would be insupportable	2515.0726844366204
The officer was the very Mr Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire and he bowed as they passed	149.24955450518294
If his own vanity however did not mislead him was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that Jane had suffered and still continued to suffer	41.011270705513006
I cannot misunderstand you but I intreat you dear Lizzy not to pain me by thinking to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk	71.09709432312432
For we must attribute this happy conclusion she added in a great measure to his kindness	873.3261623828432
But how did he account for it It must have been his sisters doing	2154.4346900318833
the happiest wisest most reasonable end In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley whose conference with her father had been short and to the purpose	61.05402296585327
The room in which the ladies sat was backwards	2390.6215493862082
His debts to be discharged and something still to remain	3393.7481503500094
Oh	1.2848575558448747
The more I see of the world the more am I dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit or sense	12.91549665014884
The faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in the business had given something more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty	11.006941712522094
Illustration Morning Dress	19.280007499081826
Howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs Collins but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter to whom I have related the affair	22.456979955397745
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party I assure you I feel it exceedingly said Lady Catherine I believe nobody feels the loss of friends so much as I do	29.552092352028872
I will not spend hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again Well all I know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him	20.691380811147894
who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual	52.983169062837085

Lizzy why am I thus singled from my family and blessed above them all	2154.4346900318833
Two inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief and the other that she herself had been barbarously used by them all and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day	11.006941712522094
I cannot find out that I hate her at all or that I am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl	61.05402296585327
Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through Longbourn house	3723.8763372033345
Colonel Fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but Mr Darcy they had only seen at church	149.24955450518294
Not that think Charlotte so plain but then she is our particular friend She seems a very pleasant young woman said Bingley	149.24955450518294
How could you begin said she	627.2367209905697
The two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax Mr Bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at Netherfield	14.547578108480476
London Printed for T	75.02768110737455
I know we dine with four and twenty families Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his countenance	187.38174228603845
and so extremely accomplished for her age	1120.6900652727268
What am I to do Nothing child nothing	1537.8209446592753
I hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it I will carry my point In this manner Lady Catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added I take no leave of you Miss Bennet	12.216773489967919
Good gracious cried Mrs Bennet as she stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable Mr Darcy is not coming here again with our dear Bingley	52.983169062837085
But as no such delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require Jane to confess that if he did not come back she should think herself very ill used	11.583232862547103
But that gentleman looking at Darcy seemed to think the country was nothing at all Indeed Mama you are mistaken said Elizabeth blushing for her mother	71.09709432312432
What relates to yourself is as follows	1046.3393929311092
They found Mary as usual deep in the study of thorough bass and human nature and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of thread bare morality to listen to	29.552092352028872
The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt	873.3261623828432
I have therefore made up my mind to tell you that I do not want to dance a reel at all and now despise me if you dare Indeed I do not dare Elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her	4.071515547789689
She liked him too little to care for his approbation	3194.4674919357367
He only told me what I have now told you Elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation	149.24955450518294
His consenting to marry her is a proof I will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking	187.38174228603845

For forty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support	316.227766016838
To congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said You are mistaken Mr Darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner She saw him start at this but he said nothing and she continued You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it Again his astonishment was obvious and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification	2.303132058706997
I wonder my aunt did not tell us of Dining out said Mrs Bennet that is very unlucky Can I have the carriage said Jane	83.76776400682921

The hill crowned with wood from which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object	240.40991835099712
She could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess	14.547578108480476
I rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen	3727.5937203149383
CHAPTER I	1.284857555844875
In an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better	100.00000000000001
The dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more I think than last year	83.76776400682921
Well well said he do not make yourself unhappy	2196.172464288084
Thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where I assure you there are many amiable young women	20.691380811147894
Vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrouled	579.9085843097012
Well any friend of Mr Bingleys will always be welcome here to be sure but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern	24.484367468222267
Elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect	3727.5937203149383
Miss Bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr Darcys progress through book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some inquiry or looking at his page	29.552092352028872
It is very unlucky but as I have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now The astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of Mrs Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while	6.812920690579612
Let me first see how he behaves said she it will then be early enough for expectation She sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door	8.778013135972484

You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one I cannot pretend to be sorry said Wickham after a short interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with I believe it does not often happen	11.583232862547103
It would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the day Much more rational my dear Caroline I dare say but it would not be near so much like a ball Miss Bingley made no answer and soon afterwards got up and walked about the room	8.431909292866257
Good gracious	1.284857555844875
As soon as they had driven from the door Elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at Rosings which for Charlottes sake she made more favourable than it really was	16.57723885589317
If therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added I shall know how to understand it	61.05402296585327
I do assure you that I am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time	20.691380811147894
When Darcy returned to the saloon Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister	83.76776400682921
Miss Bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth	32.74549162877729
Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an interest in him His misfortunes repeated Darcy contemptuously yes his misfortunes have been great indeed And of your infliction cried Elizabeth with energy	24.484367468222267
And what claims has Lydia what attractions has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well	36.51741272548377
Oh no But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham No I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did But you know it when I have told you what happened the very next day She then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham	6.40400427119728
He was too happy however to need much attention and luckily for the others the business of love making relieved them from a great deal of his company	52.983169062837085
But our visitor was very obstinate	627.2367209905697
Had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you	12.216773489967919
But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed and their raptures continued with little intermission to the very day of Lydias leaving home	100.00000000000001
Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do Oh yes	2154.4346900318833
When is your next ball to be Lizzy To morrow fortnight Aye so it is cried her mother and Mrs Long does not come back till the day before so it will be impossible for her to introduce him for she will not know him herself Then my dear you may have the advantage of your friend and introduce Mr Bingley to Impossible Mr Bennet impossible when I am not acquainted with him myself how can you be so teazing I honour your circumspection	3.874675120456131
He who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry	149.24955450518294
If you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment	15.505157798326243
His disposition must be dreadful I will not trust myself on the subject replied Wickham can hardly be just to him Elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed To treat in such a manner the god son the friend the favourite of his father She could have added A young man too like whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable but she contented herself with And one too who had probably been his own companion from childhood connected together as I think you said in the closest manner We were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care	2.4244620170823286
Can I speak plainer	97.91709669801119
At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving Mr Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner	12.216773489967919
I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday Her daughter Miss de Bourgh will have a very large fortune and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates This information made Elizabeth smile as she thought of poor Miss Bingley	10.481131341546856
My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of thinking	2154.4346900318833
Oh	1.2848575558448747
Four nieces of Mrs Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that I recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her	16.57723885589317
It was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor	599.4842503189408
At length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house	240.40991835099712
It soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus self attracted by the rest of her family and as she considered that Janes disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond any thing she had ever known before	5.4361836201538365
With his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning	61.05402296585327
I knew it myself as it was known to Miss Bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it That they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger Perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me It is done however and it was done for the best On this subject I have nothing more to say no other apology to offer	4.003221666659723
But I am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general	873.3261623828432
Mrs Bennet treasured up the hint and trusted that she might soon have two daughters married and the man whom she could not bear to speak of the day before was now high in her good graces	20.691380811147894
I dare say he often hears worse things said than I am going to say	1333.521432163324
The apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts	14.547578108480476
A single man of large fortune four or five thousand a year	3844.316056740216
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected	83.76776400682921
You will find her manners beyond any thing I can describe and your wit and vivacity I think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite	20.691380811147894
She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing Mr Darcy that Mr Darcy might leave the country but that should stand his ground yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball the very next week	19.14481976169958
A low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing	1333.521432163324
She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia and removed from the influence of Lydias example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid	32.74549162877729

Miss Lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane	83.76776400682921
Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed	3111.5279445715732
How long has she been such a favourite and pray when am I to wish you joy That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask	52.983169062837085
His most particular friend you see by Janes account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her	428.1332398719392
The letter was to this effect MY DEAR LIZZY I wish you joy	3727.5937203149383
The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again during the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr Collins	52.983169062837085
But gracious me	19.280007499081826
Darcy said nothing at all	233.27986212425483
As long as she stays there it is all very well	3863.9604807431015
Everything wore a happier aspect	289.3073146308603
Sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion	599.4842503189408
No my dear you had better go on horseback because it seems likely to rain and then you must stay all night That would be a good scheme said Elizabeth if you were sure that they would not offer to send her home Oh	12.91549665014884
where where is my uncle cried Elizabeth darting from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and Mr Darcy appeared	11.583232862547103
We were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary	2154.4346900318833
I write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read	7.813707376518094
I can recal nothing worse	289.3073146308603
By this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter I wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent	20.691380811147894

Mrs Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while Sir William remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent	36.51741272548377
To Jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection	4801.80262153646
But I will not repine	175.22022023027833
But does not Jane correspond with the sister	1760.060344050462
To be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farm house	22.456979955397745
The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic	3727.5937203149383
I have nothing to say against he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have I should think you could not do better	36.51741272548377
They now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought	4100.3368678999
When the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence	100.00000000000001
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of any thing else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise	19.14481976169958
How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from ones own daughters I cannot understand and all for the sake of Mr Collins too Why should have it more than anybody else I leave it to yourself to determine said Mr Bennet	11.583232862547103
CHAPTER XVII	1.284857555844875
What a good joke it will be	802.9402152659849
Mrs Bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read Well Jane who is it from	149.24955450518294
He stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young ladys whispering to Elizabeth again he walked away	100.00000000000001
Mr Darcy you cannot deny the fact I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party True and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room	20.691380811147894
It was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground	3586.223593070213
She was disappointed and angry with herself for being so	3071.2511016511903
Her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome	428.1332398719392
The separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic	4668.333001891534
cannot have been always at Longbourn Elizabeth looked surprised	2390.6215493862082
It is because he will not give himself the trouble I certainly have not the talent which some people possess said Darcy of conversing easily with those I have never seen before	32.74549162877729
His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now established only as a tenant Miss Bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table nor was Mrs Hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her	6.218001087320917
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt	1655.8735216287728
If as I conclude will be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business I will immediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement	22.456979955397745
Her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for Mr Gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little	4.641588833612779
And in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away	428.1332398719392
They are in the same profession you know only in different lines	4515.283169108135
Jane will be quite an old maid soon I declare	3038.8994495021866
They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves	52.983169062837085
yes	1.2848575558448747
My dear father I congratulate you And have you answered the letter said Elizabeth	2154.4346900318833
It is impossible that he should still love me After walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water plant there chanced to be a little alteration	8.431909292866257
Mr Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend is he Poor Eliza to be only just I beg you would not put it into Lizzys head to be vexed by his ill treatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him	7.53690398089854
At length Darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said Mr Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his friends whether he may be equally capable of them is less certain He has been so unlucky as to lose friendship replied Elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life Darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject	4.840960141478948
the story which followed of his designs on Miss Darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel Fitzwilliam himself from whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousins affairs and whose character she had no reason to question	5.30441727984393
Here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse	1760.060344050462
But so they always are	289.3073146308603
I am astonished my dear said Mrs Bennet that you should be so ready to think your own children silly	240.40991835099712
They have both said she been deceived I dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea	149.24955450518294
She then took a large house in Edward street and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings	599.4842503189408
It was first broken by Mrs Annesley a genteel agreeable looking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others and between her and Mrs Gardiner with occasional help from Elizabeth the conversation was carried on	10.0
He must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on	240.40991835099712
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not	599.4842503189408
Such very superior dancing is not often seen	1760.060344050462
Kitty is slight and delicate and Mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on	187.38174228603845
My watchfulness has been effectual and though I should certainly be a more interesting object to all my acquaintance were I distractedly in love with him I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance	24.484367468222267
But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice	5346.783134922081
Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere	52.983169062837085
He confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the ill consequences of Lydias flight on her own folly alone	22.456979955397745
I	1.2848575558448747
I came to you without a doubt of my reception	2678.719741128558
And is it really true	289.3073146308603
Every object in the next days journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight	8.778013135972484
While the contents of the first letter remained on her mind she was all surprise all astonishment that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible	13.68874509537081
She could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what Lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended	16.57723885589317
Mr Darcy felt their rudeness and immediately said This walk is not wide enough for our party	599.4842503189408
She listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners	41.011270705513006
	1.2848575558448747
She looked at Jane to see how she bore it but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley	428.1332398719392
Wherever you and Jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple of or I may say three very silly sisters	29.552092352028872
Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest The colour now rushed into Elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued You look conscious	5.722367659350217
But it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again	187.38174228603845
An airing would do me a great deal of good I am sure	3579.5117091006086
And his behaviour so strikingly altered what could it mean	3393.7481503500094
And for we are to be thankful	878.6261914683503
What is to become of us	495.69628172386786
They were able to love each other even as well as they intended	3727.5937203149383
Mrs Hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves	100.00000000000001
The farewell between herself and Mr Wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even more	1333.521432163324
The family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them	3667.6056775466873
As for Mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table This is a most unfortunate affair and will probably be much talked of	17.782794100389232
However your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and I am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves Mrs Gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of Jane and Elizabeths correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation	5.878016072274914

And pray may I ask but checking himself he added in a gayer tone Is it in address that he improves	187.38174228603845
and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too	1990.7862058391763
Those who chose to be idle certainly might Aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if I had known your mother I should have advised her most strenuously to engage one	22.456979955397745
I quite forgot	19.280007499081826
In the former were many good paintings but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible	11.006941712522094
I have not forgot you see and I assure you I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection and said something of his concern at having been prevented by business	12.216773489967919
Yours very sincerely M	97.91709669801119
While Sir William was with them Mr Collins devoted his mornings to driving him out in his gig and shewing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of window in his own book room which fronted the road	3.359818286283782
And pray Lizzy what said Lady Catherine about this report	3194.4674919357367
You must not suspect me	256.084676093353
You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane	2890.9074477977106
Mr Collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family	599.4842503189408
The comfort to of the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond expression	5079.894397423908
After abusing you so abominably to your face I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations What did you say of me that I did not deserve	36.51741272548377
But to be sure the good lady who shewed us the house did give him a most flaming character	316.227766016838
All were struck with the strangers air all wondered who he could be and Kitty and Lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretence of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot	7.53690398089854
It was all conjecture What is it you mean It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known because if it were to get round to the ladys family it would be an unpleasant thing You may depend upon my not mentioning it And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley	6.042963902381328

Here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind	22.456979955397745
It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Carolines interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of every one	19.14481976169958
He was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting	316.227766016838
Mrs Hurst thought the same and added She has nothing in short to recommend her but being an excellent walker	240.40991835099712
He is come Mr Bingley is come He is indeed	3038.899449502187
At length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said How pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way	12.216773489967919
That will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him Consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husbands incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see Mr Bingley in consequence of it before did	9.152473108773892
Not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them	121.15276586285881
If it was not allowable for him to gain affections because I had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so soon after this event A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe	5.0608719869196825
My poor father	19.280007499081826
Have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin Yes and I had heard it before	100.00000000000001
Can it be possible that he will marry her Wickham is not so undeserving then as we have thought him said her sister	121.15276586285881
On this subject what can you have to say	2004.0145275309874
She represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect	83.76776400682921
You have no compassion on my poor nerves You mistake me my dear	3727.5937203149383
There are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters Mr Wickhams attention was caught and after observing Mr Collins for a few moments he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh	6.218001087320917
Must it be so Oh lord	579.9085843097012

Jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever	100.00000000000001
Her performance on the piano forte is exquisite It is amazing to me said Bingley how young ladies can have patience to be so very accomplished as they all are All young ladies accomplished	26.826957952797255

Will you do me the honour of reading that letter And then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight	61.05402296585327
I have no reason I assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception	1333.521432163324
Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy	3228.4752973329614
If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one You must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course	7.2789538439831505
But her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent	599.4842503189408

At length however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while Mrs Reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him to morrow with a large party of friends How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day	8.431909292866257
He had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce	4.840960141478948
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together	316.227766016838
He did every thing best in the world and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of September than any body else in the country	46.415888336127786

If it was not for the entail I should not mind it What should not you mind I should not mind any thing at all Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility I never can be thankful Mr Bennet for any thing about the entail	8.778013135972484
c and if she would give him leave would take an early opportunity of waiting on them	599.4842503189408
They will have nothing else to do Mr Wickhams adieus were much more affectionate than his wifes	599.4842503189408
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err	9.55855309468529
that he should have been in love with her for so many months	3089.964949182251
There is no danger of Wickhams marrying Mary King	2347.3383439049167
After walking several miles in a leisurely manner and too busy to know any thing about it they found at last on examining their watches that it was time to be at home	29.552092352028872
Jane was beyond competition her favourite child	1120.6900652727268
After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began In vain have I struggled	149.24955450518294
These two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner watching the sentinel on guard and dressing a sallad and cucumber	46.415888336127786
I believe I have now told you every thing	1924.3086287587357
My temper would perhaps be called resentful My good opinion once lost is lost for ever is a failing indeed cried Elizabeth	149.24955450518294
You never will be able to make both of them good for any thing	2154.4346900318833
Their brother is a pleasant gentleman like man he is a great friend of Darcys Oh	873.3261623828432
You see how continually we are engaged there	1655.8735216287728
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of Mr Darcys civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister	10.0
That he was not a good tempered man had been her firmest opinion	3727.5937203149383
Three daughters married	19.280007499081826
I hope my dear said Mr Bennet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner to day because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party Who do you mean my dear	12.216773489967919
But still he would be her husband Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only honourable provision for well educated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want	10.0
Are you going much farther No I should have turned in a moment And accordingly she did turn and they walked towards the Parsonage together	83.76776400682921
I shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn but I wish you would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up	29.552092352028872
I see what you are feeling replied Charlotte you must be surprised very much surprised so lately as Mr Collins was wishing to marry you	83.76776400682921
Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining parlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a pleasanter aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for Mr Collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement	4.948168092155143
it is of no consequence	264.0029742293326
The wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in Derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this	61.05402296585327
We will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had not Jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted	6.812920690579612
It cannot be for it cannot be for sake that his manners are thus softened	1333.521432163324
Now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence For the liveliness of your mind I did You may as well call it impertinence at once	61.05402296585327
He could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me	149.24955450518294
She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her	240.40991835099712
CHAPTER X	1.284857555844875
There was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies	5346.783134922081
The carriage was sent to meet them at and they were to return in it by dinner time	428.1332398719392
The arrival of letters was the first grand object of every mornings impatience	3727.5937203149383
But I can assure you she added that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing	41.011270705513006
He coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to Scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry	13.68874509537081
Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her intreaty that would not give into it	121.15276586285881
I have heard you mention them with consideration these twenty years at least Ah	2154.4346900318833
An express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from Colonel Forster to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland with one of his officers to own the truth with Wickham Imagine our surprise	14.547578108480476
Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret	428.1332398719392
Be assured my dear Sir that Mrs Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove	16.57723885589317
She is so fond of Mrs Forster said she it will be quite shocking to send her away	428.1332398719392
Who would have thought it	229.19308289941296
But I have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr Darcy had been over rated Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs Gardiners long letter but now having to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows I would have thanked you before my dear aunt as I ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but to say the truth I was too cross to write	2.9328491084381394
She would be in nobodys way you know in that part of the house Mr Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunts ill breeding and made no answer	46.415888336127786
It was lady Catherine de Bourgh	441.3930545144779
If I had ever learnt I should have been a great proficient	3462.5024979991585
Poor Charlotte it was melancholy to leave her to such society But she had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion	19.14481976169958
She was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when	428.1332398719392
I would keep a pack of foxhounds and drink a bottle of wine every day Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought said Mrs Bennet and if I were to see you at it I should take away your bottle directly The boy protested that she should not she continued to declare that she would and the argument ended only with the visit	5.4361836201538365
Colonel Forster will I dare say do every thing in his power to satisfy us on this head	428.1332398719392
Elizabeth had settled it that Mr Darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching Pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning	17.782794100389232
Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs Bennet one communication would therefore do for all	1333.521432163324
Her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself	873.3261623828432
Mr Bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene	2390.6215493862082
began the evening well Charlotte said Mrs Bennet with civil self command to Miss Lucas	1333.521432163324
It was not till the afternoon when he joined them at tea that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied Say nothing of that	17.782794100389232
LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND If you discover a defect in this electronic work within days of receiving it you can receive a refund of the money if any you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from	11.006941712522094
To be sure that seem as if he admired her indeed I rather believe he I heard something about it but I hardly know what something about Mr Robinson Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr Robinson did not I mention it to you	11.006941712522094
I cannot make him out There is something very pompous in his style And what can he mean by apologizing for being next in the entail We cannot suppose he would help it if he could Can he be a sensible man sir No my dear I think not	10.0
If youll believe me I did not once put my foot out of doors though I was there a fortnight	240.40991835099712
In every thing else she is as good natured a girl as ever lived	2154.4346900318833
It was in the Times and the Courier I know though it was not put in as it ought to be	187.38174228603845
But do not imagine that he is always here so often	3235.2263324634932
Of his former way of life nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told himself	599.4842503189408
Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure	71.09709432312432
And to be kept back on a motive I think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind Upon my word said her Ladyship you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person Pray what is your age With three younger sisters grown up replied Elizabeth smiling your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence	3.317671127842857
Tis an etiquette I despise said he	1120.6900652727268
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene	3.9376589235643866
Since her being at Lambton she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy	41.011270705513006
How nicely we are crammed in cried Lydia	1760.060344050462
She turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there	11.583232862547103
But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr Wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real character	83.76776400682921
After amusing himself some time with their curiosity he thus explained	4147.021935625597
There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings She was a little revived however by his bringing back his coffee cup himself and she seized the opportunity of saying Is your sister at Pemberley still Yes she will remain there till Christmas And quite alone	11.583232862547103
Mr Bennet protested against any description of finery	1760.060344050462
Whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to continue the subject	149.24955450518294
Her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine I never could perceive any thing extraordinary in them	32.74549162877729
She has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to Annes	873.3261623828432
He really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger	316.227766016838
Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day	100.00000000000001
When she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chuses Your plan is a good one replied Elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if I were determined to get a rich husband or any husband I dare say I should adopt it	6.812920690579612
But of all the views which his garden or which the country or the kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of Rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house	12.216773489967919
When Jane and Elizabeth were alone the former who had been cautious in her praise of Mr Bingley before expressed to her sister how very much she admired him	46.415888336127786
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before	240.40991835099712
But this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw Mr Darcy walk into the room	71.09709432312432
She was teazed by Mr Collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail with her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others	22.456979955397745
I am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection	240.40991835099712
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with It is turn to say something now Mr Darcy talked about the dance and ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples He smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said	6.601948484081891
YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE STRICT LIABILITY BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F	100.00000000000001
Her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to Darcy much more than to any other person in the room	9.152473108773892
Ignorant as you previously were of every thing concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination	100.00000000000001
Why must their marriage be private	627.2367209905697
But whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brothers	599.4842503189408
I feel as if I had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit and threw back the praise on her sisters warm affection	29.552092352028872
Mr Gardiner declared his willingness and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation	3727.5937203149383
Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets were particularly intimate	873.3261623828432
If it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she I should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful	121.15276586285881
Mary and Kitty thank Heaven	256.084676093353
what news	1.284857555844875
They were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wifes offers of refreshment	9.152473108773892
I dearly love a laugh Miss Bingley said he has given me credit for more than can be	428.1332398719392
No motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted	4341.218347705809
A military life is not what I was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible	599.4842503189408
Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility	83.76776400682921
Section	1.2848575558448747
My kind friends will not hear of my returning home till I am better	2154.4346900318833
No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room	5.878016072274914
But whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that Mr Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation	7.813707376518094
Since the shire were first quartered in Meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head	316.227766016838
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance	100.00000000000001
Mrs Gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but Elizabeth had turned away her head	52.983169062837085
And when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether Mr Bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man	52.983169062837085
As they passed through the hall Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining parlour and drawing room and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent looking rooms walked on	32.74549162877729
How can Mr Bingley who seems good humour itself and is I really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man	121.15276586285881
From what I can collect he left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them	100.00000000000001
She could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his self conquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress	83.76776400682921
He was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in Derbyshire	149.24955450518294
I am not romantic you know	423.65747724704926
His first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go	13.68874509537081
It had better have happened to Lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner	873.3261623828432
Not at all	16.05622570038905
The very last evening was spent there and her Ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way that Maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh	5.722367659350217
Mr Darcy	1.284857555844875
Why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more Then addressing her daughter Oh	428.1332398719392
You are quite a visit in my debt Mr Bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned	26.826957952797255
But he found Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was	3557.295583646569
When she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion	15.505157798326243
In the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger	240.40991835099712
These bitter accusations might have been suppressed had I with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by every thing	22.456979955397745
The dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its cookery was owing	61.05402296585327
Have you had any flirting	289.3073146308603
I often think said she that there is nothing so bad as parting with ones friends	873.3261623828432
Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received many months ago from Mr Wickham	873.3261623828432
unless a copyright notice is included	627.2367209905697
They had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returned to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and lady in a curricle driving up the street	8.11130830789687
A person may be proud without being vain	1760.060344050462
She was overpowered by shame and vexation	1046.3393929311092
It is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week	2154.4346900318833
One morning about a week after Bingleys engagement with Jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the dining room their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn	8.431909292866257
Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when Mrs Jenkinson expressed her fears of Miss De Bourghs being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light	20.691380811147894
He did trace them easily to Clapham but no farther for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom	41.011270705513006
Astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her	1120.6900652727268
We have not met since the th of November when we were all dancing together at Netherfield Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether her sisters were at Longbourn	10.481131341546856
She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr Collins but do not think there would have been any fun in it	187.38174228603845
It is excellent news capital news and about a certain person that we all like Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other and the waiter was told that he need not stay	32.74549162877729
Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works so the Foundation and you can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties	15.505157798326243
I do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter	240.40991835099712
You thought me then devoid of every proper feeling I am sure you did	2154.4346900318833
There was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake	36.51741272548377
The feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation Mr Darcy who was leaning against the mantle piece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise	9.152473108773892
With the Gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms	3923.2437364294296
She tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done	873.3261623828432
The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening	2154.4346900318833
Your own heart your own conscience must tell you why I come Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment	599.4842503189408
Did you ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance when you were in Kent I heard from authority which I thought that it was left you conditionally only and at the will of the present patron You have	20.691380811147894
my dear Mr Bennet as she entered the room we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball	240.40991835099712
Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recal them	24.484367468222267
They look upon it quite as their own I dare say whenever that happens It was a subject which they could not mention before me No	71.09709432312432
Indeed Mr Darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire and give me leave to say very impolitic too for it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear I am not afraid of you said he smilingly	7.038135554931555
With assumed tranquillity he then replied I have no wish of denying that I did every thing in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that I rejoice in my success	26.826957952797255
He was fond of the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments	428.1332398719392
no no this is not likely	518.6013174997153
Their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme	240.40991835099712
All was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation	3393.7481503500094
He who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister	6.601948484081891
You and papa and my sisters must come down and see us	5125.616880269244
From what can it proceed	289.3073146308603
To Kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected	2959.9989925517903
Yet it is hard she sometimes thought that this poor man cannot come to a house which he has legally hired without raising all this speculation	71.09709432312432
Our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done every thing in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness	5.30441727984393
Elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her fathers behaviour as a husband	873.3261623828432
His words seemed to imply it	627.2367209905697
You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what I look on as a point of duty	46.415888336127786
It was a journey of only twenty four miles and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch street by noon	121.15276586285881
On their being joined by Mr Bingley himself Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before Mr Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery	8.11130830789687
Well my dear said he when she ceased speaking I have no more to say	1333.521432163324
My visit was not long as Caroline and Mrs Hurst were going out	3727.5937203149383
Mr Darcy looked just as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire paid his compliments with his usual reserve to Mrs Collins and whatever might be his feelings towards her friend met her with every appearance of composure	17.782794100389232
I remember as soon as ever I saw him when he first came into Hertfordshire last year I thought how likely it was that you should come together	52.983169062837085
You thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared	4084.357217789265
She coloured as she spoke but neither that nor any thing else awakened a suspicion of the truth	428.1332398719392
I should infinitely prefer a book But of this answer Lydia heard not a word	1333.521432163324
no it is not for to be driven away by Mr Darcy	3886.6714385339824
Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is I shall know what to think She is a very good kind of girl I believe	5.4361836201538365
I thought I should have broke my heart I am sure I shall break said Lydia	873.3261623828432
Mr and Mrs Collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeys and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself her family under less than the present distance Mr Darcy drew his chair a little towards her and said cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment	7.038135554931555
How is such a man to be worked on	1709.297021155719
They could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same	873.3261623828432
Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time Mr Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr Bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it	7.53690398089854
He assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening	14.547578108480476
CHAPTER XVI	1.284857555844875
Their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency	599.4842503189408
My sister I am sure will not hear of her removal You may depend upon it Madam said Miss Bingley with cold civility that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she remains with us Mrs Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments	13.68874509537081
It had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either Jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills	6.601948484081891
Well he is a very undeserving young man and I do not suppose there is the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now	61.05402296585327
Indeed you are mistaken Madam	233.6861625136001
Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as I was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that I cannot accuse myself of having really done any thing to deserve to lose it	9.152473108773892
She could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in Hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at Netherfield as he ought to be	12.216773489967919
Elizabeths impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr Darcy and herself	9.152473108773892
the ladies had crowded round the table where Miss Bennet was making tea and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair	17.782794100389232
Bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening Mrs Bennets invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter	46.415888336127786
If she heard me it was by good luck for I am sure she did not listen	599.4842503189408
When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgrace when she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage the difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible	4.071515547789689
I did not think Caroline in spirits were her words but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to London	36.51741272548377
A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved All this she must possess added Darcy and to all this she must yet add something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive reading I am no longer surprised at your knowing six accomplished women	3.4485331776221058
My excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to Mr Wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allow and if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as soon as it became vacant	5.722367659350217
His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the ill judged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter	13.68874509537081
Elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr Darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it	15.505157798326243
At least therefore I did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to shew off before the ladies I dare say you believed it but I am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity	16.57723885589317
There is nothing else to be done	721.9980295728132
What could your ladyship propose by it At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted Your coming to Longbourn to see me and my family said Elizabeth coolly will be rather a confirmation of it if indeed such a report is in existence If	11.006941712522094
What could he mean	97.91709669801119
After sitting a little while with Jane on Miss Bingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour	83.76776400682921
My dear Madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what I have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as possible They were all astonished and Mr Bennet who could by no means wish for so speedy a return immediately said But is there not danger of Lady Catherines disapprobation here my good sir You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of offending your patroness My dear sir replied Mr Collins I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyships concurrence You cannot be too much on your guard	2.51188643150958
But little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there	873.3261623828432

His air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal	4710.351154021535
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of Mr Darcys sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road	19.14481976169958
Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening Elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for Wickham resentment against his enemies and every thing else gave way before the hope of Janes being in the fairest way for happiness	5.878016072274914

But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was	873.3261623828432
He has many friends and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing If he means to be but little at Netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there	8.431909292866257
He had never had the slightest suspicion	1046.3393929311092
I am prodigiously proud of him	579.9085843097012
He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem	1333.521432163324
A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other and out of their months acquaintance they had been intimate	71.09709432312432
Not one party or scheme or any thing	1634.5799516636096
Kitty was the only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy	873.3261623828432
U S	1.284857555844875
Every thing nourishes what is strong already	1120.6900652727268
You may well be surprised Miss Bennet at such an assertion after seeing as you probably might the very cold manner of our meeting yesterday Are you much acquainted with Mr Darcy As much as I ever wish to be cried Elizabeth warmly I have spent four days in the same house with him and I think him very disagreeable I have no right to give opinion said Wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwise	4.460162165376301
Maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire	873.3261623828432
CHAPTER XIV	1.284857555844875
Well I am sure I shall be extremely glad to see Mr Bingley But good lord	873.3261623828432
Unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of Janes happiness and so dishonourable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its frequently recurring	46.415888336127786
This he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed	187.38174228603845
I am sorry to say it of them but so it is	3855.557097067778
Mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs Bennets being quite unable to sit alone	52.983169062837085
We can all plague and punish one another	1655.8735216287728
Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs Bennet and they gave way only to the greater distress of Mr Bingleys continued absence	149.24955450518294
It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife	121.15276586285881
Girls can I do any thing for you in Meryton	3194.4674919357367
A man who has once been refused	928.5963181931988
The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value She was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sisters spirits	29.552092352028872
To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying	1760.060344050462
Yes if Darcy does not put it off again	2262.8745249117715
One may be continually abusive without saying any thing just but one cannot be always laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty Lizzy when you first read that letter I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now Indeed I could not	9.152473108773892
They would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds	4147.021935625597
They were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them	4461.823583355281
Miss Bingleys eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps	149.24955450518294
I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy Are you indeed	2154.4346900318833
Mr Collins and Charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party	24.484367468222267
It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine Both replied Elizabeth archly for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds We are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb This is no very striking resemblance of your own character I am sure said he	2.4757157946593416
I am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for I ought not to have mentioned the subject	61.05402296585327
Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to Jane while Mrs Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor	16.57723885589317
His reception however was of the most flattering kind	2219.585546854552
His attachment to Rosings certainly increases Mr Collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter	52.983169062837085
After breakfast the girls walked to Meryton to inquire if Mr Wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball	100.00000000000001
Perhaps he thought her too young	627.2367209905697
But enough of this	97.91709669801119
Oh	1.2848575558448747
His debts are to be paid amounting I believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon and his commission purchased	46.415888336127786
Elizabeths eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for Mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another	5.878016072274914
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did	29.552092352028872
for I dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone that he is improved in essentials Oh no said Elizabeth	100.00000000000001
That they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice	149.24955450518294
Only let me assure you my dear Miss Elizabeth that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage	121.15276586285881
Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted You can have nothing farther to say she resentfully answered	316.227766016838
Every thing that is charming	289.3073146308603
While in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family	11.006941712522094
Your father was gone your uncle at home and as I said before they had a great deal of talk together	187.38174228603845
Much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married	12.216773489967919
Gracechurch street Sept	19.280007499081826
Your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable If it be so if I have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable	26.826957952797255
Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade in Meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the King during his mayoralty	29.552092352028872
Mr Collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance	6.218001087320917
I did not expect such a compliment Did not you	2247.257322860308
Anxiety on Janes behalf was another prevailing concern and Mr Darcys explanation by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what Jane had lost	46.415888336127786
He was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her	3727.5937203149383
The others have been gone on to Scarborough these three weeks She could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success	32.74549162877729
I have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle	1333.521432163324
In short I will do my best Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very often	149.24955450518294
CHAPTER XV	1.284857555844875
How could I ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love	2154.4346900318833
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcys opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps	4.142704447847673
On Mr and Mrs Gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with the utmost politeness	26.826957952797255
Not like the wild young men now a days who think of nothing but themselves	1333.521432163324
Family pride and pride for he is very proud of what his father was have done this	599.4842503189408
The very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for the winter and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left the country	14.547578108480476
That he was by the connexion was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with Mr Gardiner	36.51741272548377
Your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us These are heavy misfortunes replied Elizabeth	121.15276586285881
I was uncomfortable enough	97.91709669801119
I am only ashamed of his asking so little And they marry	4869.767824200445
Nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant	240.40991835099712
Mr Bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mothers fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his	10.0
If he wants our society let him seek it	2525.580331332133
Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but had never seen any thing but affability in her	240.40991835099712
They entered it in one of its lowest points and drove for some time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent	121.15276586285881
It adds even another motive	289.3073146308603
As a brother a landlord a master she considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianship How much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow How much of good or evil must be done by him	15.505157798326243
Allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear Miss Eliza glancing at her sister and Bingley shall take place	13.68874509537081
He was writing and without raising his head coolly replied Just as you please May we take my uncles letter to read to her Take whatever you like and get away Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up stairs together	12.216773489967919
Had Elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heart felt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable	7.038135554931555
Multiple superscripted characters are enclosed by curly brackets example M rs	4341.218347705809
I was in the middle before I knew that I begun My beauty you had early withstood and as for my manners my behaviour to was at least always bordering on the uncivil and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not	10.481131341546856
to Miss Lydia Bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or any thing	149.24955450518294
But when they had withdrawn he said to her Mrs Bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding	32.74549162877729
We must trespass a little longer on your kindness Removed cried Bingley	5054.080905121878
But I will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happy your affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt	41.011270705513006
Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind	149.24955450518294
Wretched wretched mistake Darcy made no answer	796.8784691054008
But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I will ever recede	3727.5937203149383
The children have been wanting me this half hour	2390.6215493862082
never saw such capacity and taste and application and elegance as you describe united Mrs Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when Mr Hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward	6.601948484081891
Lady Catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephews letter that Charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over	29.552092352028872
But the fact is that being as I am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer I could not satisfy myself without resolving to chuse a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes place which however as I have already said may not be for several years	4.840960141478948
It is such a spur to ones genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind	240.40991835099712
At that moment she cared for no other	1537.8209446592753
Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us If I were as rich as Mr Darcy cried a young Lucas who came with his sisters I should not care how proud I was	13.68874509537081
It will not do	80.89199344230427
As her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence	5346.783134922081
To the little town of Lambton the scene of Mrs Gardiners former residence and where she had lately learned that some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of Lambton Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated	8.431909292866257
Mr Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than any thing else could do	149.24955450518294
His character was decided	87.7319564626089
He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune	11.006941712522094
I will go to Meryton said she as soon as I am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister Philips	121.15276586285881
But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentleman like appearance walking with an officer on the other side of the way	24.484367468222267
The moment of her release from him was ecstacy	2390.6215493862082
And one of my own daughters	492.91438437641636
She said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in Darcys breast there was a tolerable powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another	10.0
CHAPTER XXIII	1.284857555844875
I expected to find a more reasonable young woman	2362.9358734847483
For my part I am determined never to speak of it again to anybody	2154.4346900318833
Could he or the Lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related	46.415888336127786
He then handed her in Maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings	17.782794100389232
What a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been gladly and gratefully received	32.74549162877729
Not a word however passed his lips in allusion to it till their visitor took his leave for the night but as soon as he was gone he turned to his daughter and said Jane I congratulate you	19.14481976169958
Ah	1.2848575558448747
Long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided	5125.616880269244
There is a gentleman with him mamma said Kitty who can it be Some acquaintance or other my dear I suppose I am sure I do not know La replied Kitty it looks just like that man that used to be with him before	12.91549665014884
So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to easy temper or affectionate heart	240.40991835099712
But you do not know	136.88066583769532
What a letter is this to be written at such a moment	4189.138857946133
With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did January and February pass away	36.51741272548377
Yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin Elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentlemans proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of Have you any idea Lizzy who this gentleman is	9.55855309468529
Tell her that you insist upon her marrying him Let her be called down	2154.4346900318833
You used us abominably ill answered Mrs Hurst in running away without telling us that you were coming out Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr Darcy she left Elizabeth to walk by herself	26.826957952797255
She was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what	2154.4346900318833
No look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard	2949.627097378071
I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point	1333.521432163324
You must contrive to send somebody	627.2367209905697
But I confess they would have no charms for	2347.3383439049167
But do not be cast down	527.3034436545236
But no letter appeared and she was completely puzzled	1962.2781500423623
Such was Miss Lucass scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon	24.484367468222267
I wonder what he can be doing there Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh said Elizabeth	316.227766016838
my sweetest Lizzy	19.280007499081826
Oh	1.2848575558448747
In this room they were received by Miss Darcy who was sitting there with Mrs Hurst and Miss Bingley and the lady with whom she lived in London	52.983169062837085
His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind	1333.521432163324
There I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered I begin to think it perfectly reasonable	121.15276586285881
It is not quite a week since they left Brighton	2880.675064656359
Mrs Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcys delight when she should enter the room	5125.616880269244
She would not even wish for any renewal of his attentions	3670.798197728764
She answered him with cold civility	536.151591419881
And pray what sort of guardians do you make	2172.8729578876346
Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs Bennet and the children	2154.4346900318833
Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and Jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance	14.547578108480476
But Lizzy you can tell us whether it is like or not Mrs Reynoldss respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master	52.983169062837085
She had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks But not before they went to Brighton No I believe not And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself	20.691380811147894
It had come with a fare from London and as he thought the circumstance of a gentleman and ladys removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make enquiries at Clapham	24.484367468222267
She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a very agreeable companion	8.11130830789687
You will be censured slighted and despised by every one connected with him	3727.5937203149383
The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliners shop just over the way	12.216773489967919
This is your final resolve	289.3073146308603
There is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you Will you allow me or do I ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton The surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it	5.179474679231211
I hope your plans in favour of the shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood Oh	240.40991835099712
was exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire but I would not tell you how little I was satisfied with behaviour while she staid with us if I had not perceived by Janes letter last Wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what I now tell you can give you no fresh pain	5.575305334261898
But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else Here you are in your own family Upon my word I say no more than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood except Netherfield	10.0
My sole dependence was on you and I am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not	316.227766016838
That tall proud man Good gracious	627.2367209905697
But there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and I dare say very agreeable	149.24955450518294
I will read it to you When my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to London might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel	3.9376589235643866
The satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place	61.05402296585327
Sir William how can you tell such a story Do not you know that Mr Collins wants to marry Lizzy Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but Sir Williams good breeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy	4.948168092155143
I never heard any thing so abominable	890.3503893076473
And on the gentlemens approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper The men shant come and part us I am determined	41.011270705513006
They had long wished to see him	841.4418770786045
The particulars I reserve till we meet	1120.6900652727268
Catherine and Lydia had information for them of a different sort	3557.295583646569
The walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met	316.227766016838
Have not you always hated him How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate	100.00000000000001
The rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor but Elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of splendor and more real elegance than the furniture of Rosings	12.216773489967919
As it was certain however that somebody was coming Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubbery	36.51741272548377
Tis as good as a Lord	579.9085843097012
I am all astonishment	97.91709669801119
You wanted me I know to say Yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt	22.456979955397745
But I ought to beg his pardon for I have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant	240.40991835099712
no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both	873.3261623828432
Lydia gaped as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with Do you know mama that my uncle Philips talks of turning away Richard and if he does Colonel Forster will hire him	12.91549665014884
He called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself	149.24955450518294
It was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned	7.038135554931555
Her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself and her family ridiculous	121.15276586285881
When dinner was over she returned directly to Jane and Miss Bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room	100.00000000000001
They stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family	19.14481976169958
In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and unvarying society But people themselves alter so much that there is something new to be observed in them for ever Yes indeed cried Mrs Bennet offended by his manner of mentioning a country neighbourhood	12.216773489967919
If she is half as sharp as her mother she is saving enough	3727.5937203149383
Calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly	61.05402296585327
He merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention And my mother How is she	121.15276586285881
But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information	149.24955450518294
Can there be any other opinion on the subject Yes there can for mine is totally different Will you hear it Most willingly You shall have it in few words	41.011270705513006
or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others You take an eager interest in that gentlemans concerns said Darcy in a less tranquil tone and with a heightened colour	36.51741272548377
The good news quickly spread through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood	1333.521432163324
He shall not be in love with me if I can prevent it Elizabeth you are not serious now I beg your pardon	121.15276586285881
Here are officers enough at Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country	1333.521432163324
Pray how Mr Bingleys love I never saw a more promising inclination	4841.132343682902
The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be safe for her that she was not enough recovered but Jane was firm where she felt herself to be right	10.481131341546856
Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said In such cases as this it is I believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned	10.481131341546856
He is a gentleman I am a gentlemans daughter so far we are equal True	1333.521432163324
When they had gained their own room Jane taking out the letter said This is from Caroline Bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal	61.05402296585327
I speak feelingly	19.280007499081826
People say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas but however I hope it is not true	316.227766016838
His circumstances he assured me and I had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad	873.3261623828432
Elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied	24.484367468222267
She was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence I am happy to add that I owed the knowledge of it to herself	46.415888336127786
Mrs Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think any thing less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year	6.042963902381328
Your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather Poor Wickham there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance	26.826957952797255
I thank you again and again for not going to the Lakes	3297.159853508077
Mrs Bennet was really in a most pitiable state	1882.3891285666257
He was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their chusing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere	15.505157798326243
I shall never be quite happy till I have been all round the park	2154.4346900318833
By Mrs Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments	32.74549162877729
Our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark Lydias character	83.76776400682921
Is not he a charming man	579.9085843097012
He spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided	873.3261623828432
Mr whats his name	97.91709669801119
She saw all the glories of the camp its tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once	10.0
But the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties Your attendance upon her has been too much for you	100.00000000000001
Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be unpardonable in Exceed their income	3727.5937203149383
The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see Mr Darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to Rosings where they were engaged to drink tea	11.006941712522094
Does he know his real character I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly did	149.24955450518294
What are we to do would they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe	2154.4346900318833
The dejection was almost universal	289.3073146308603
You never see a fault in any body	1760.060344050462
It was the second week in May in which the three young ladies set out together from Gracechurch street for the town of in Hertfordshire and as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr Bennets carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachmans punctuality both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining room up stairs	6.218001087320917
One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight	2154.4346900318833
And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own credit but I am an idle fellow and though I have not many I have more than I ever look into Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those in the room	10.481131341546856
They are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the fathers from respectable honourable and ancient though untitled families	100.00000000000001
I do not know when I have been more shocked said she	2437.0770759209854
His choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing	873.3261623828432
It is of all subjects my delight	1120.6900652727268
But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both I will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection He left Netherfield for London on the day following as you I am certain remember with the design of soon returning The part which I acted is now to be explained His sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in London We accordingly went and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice I described and enforced them earnestly But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination I do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance which I hesitated not in giving of your sisters indifference	1.5937828519674606
Come here child cried her father as she appeared	2525.580331332133
It was over at last however	627.2367209905697
Come as soon as you can on the receipt of this	2802.8160194521374
In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks and to Mrs Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction	61.05402296585327
He dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday	599.4842503189408
What does Mr Darcy mean said she to Charlotte by listening to my conversation with Colonel Forster That is a question which Mr Darcy only can answer But if he does it any more I shall certainly let him know that I see what he is about	11.006941712522094
To fortune I am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since I am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the per cents	19.14481976169958
By tea time however the dose had been enough and Mr Bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawing room again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies	19.14481976169958
It was the last of the regiments stay in Meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace	187.38174228603845
She knew not what to think nor how to account for it	3806.914804078672
Could there be finer symptoms	289.3073146308603
Her ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us	1760.060344050462
Accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me	3228.475297332962
is all settled That is all settled repeated the other as she ran into her room to prepare	428.1332398719392
But now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydias marriage	2154.4346900318833
You refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude	4341.218347705809
There is in every thing a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us	1333.521432163324
There are few people whom I really love and still fewer of whom I think well	873.3261623828432
FITZWILLIAM DARCY CHAPTER XIII	97.91709669801119
Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship	3727.5937203149383
The whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention	3194.4674919357367
A deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and Elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on	61.05402296585327
Mr Darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them	2154.4346900318833
You will not I hope consider me as shewing any disrespect to your family my dear Madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughters favour without having paid yourself and Mr Bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf	12.216773489967919
Soon after you left me on Saturday I was fortunate enough to find out in what part of London they were	187.38174228603845
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project Gutenberg tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph E	7.813707376518094
John told us Mr Darcy was here when you sent for us was it so Yes and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement	46.415888336127786
Mr Collins readily assented and a book was produced but on beholding it for every thing announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novels Kitty stared at him and Lydia exclaimed Other books were produced and after some deliberation he chose Fordyces Sermons	7.813707376518094
No Lizzy let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame	873.3261623828432
Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs Bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters	52.983169062837085
So much the better	70.80876763846628
She could not help frequently glancing her eye at Mr Darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her	15.505157798326243
It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in London than in Scotland But why all this secrecy	19.14481976169958
How differently did every thing now appear in which he was concerned	4302.702634499331
My father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be	428.1332398719392
That he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating And do you really know all this cried Mrs Gardiner whose curiosity as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive	29.552092352028872
Jane listened with astonishment and concern she knew not how to believe that Mr Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr Bingleys regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing therefore remained to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained	3.2374575428176438
Young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true Darcy spirit she may like to have her own way As she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth	4.948168092155143
The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw	3784.3015707929035
Darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure	20.691380811147894
However if you provide access to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg tm work in a format other than Plain Vanilla ASCII or other format used in the official version posted on the official Project Gutenberg tm web site you must at no additional cost fee or expense to the user provide a copy a means of exporting a copy or a means of obtaining a copy upon request of the work in its original Plain Vanilla ASCII or other form	4.003221666659723
They crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice wood which bordered it	8.11130830789687
My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me I shall not say that you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word I say	3.2374575428176438
The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand writing or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each	10.0
When first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention	83.76776400682921
Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these what would have been her sensations	100.00000000000001
Kitty run down and order the carriage	1120.6900652727268
no I am sure we never read the same or not with the same feelings I am sorry you think so but if that be the case there can at least be no want of subject We may compare our different opinions No I cannot talk of books in a ball room my head is always full of something else The always occupies you in such scenes does it said he with a look of doubt	4.460162165376301
Nobody can tell what I suffer But it is always so	3517.9307885617877
The sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards Jane when not immediately before them restored Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike	6.601948484081891
The two youngest of the family Catherine and Lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt	5.722367659350217
There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added When I said that he improved on acquaintance I did not mean that either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood Wickhams alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of accents You who so well know my feelings towards Mr Darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the of what is right	2.5694257109482446
But arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family	100.00000000000001
I appeal to Mr Darcy but let me not interrupt you Sir You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy but Sir Williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane who were dancing together	4.460162165376301
The gentlemen did approach and when Mr Wickham walked into the room Elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration	26.826957952797255
She began at length to recover to fidget about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself	187.38174228603845
If there were any one that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence	71.09709432312432
And who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would believe capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them	83.76776400682921
Ten thousand a year	64.4392272116307
And there are several of the young men too that she likes very much	2154.4346900318833
Elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William in which she was readily joined by Jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of Mr Collins and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London	3.359818286283782
