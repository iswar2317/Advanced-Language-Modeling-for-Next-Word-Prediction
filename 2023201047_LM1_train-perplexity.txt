CHAPTER I	1.284857555844875
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters	10.481131341546856
My dear Mr Bennet said his lady to him one day have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last Mr Bennet replied that he had not	52.983169062837085
But it is returned she for Mrs Long has just been here and she told me all about it Mr Bennet made no answer	100.00000000000001
Do not you want to know who has taken it cried his wife impatiently	2154.4346900318833
Why my dear you must know Mrs Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England that he came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with Mr Morris immediately that he is to take possession before Michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week What is his name Bingley Is he married or single Oh	3.5436477855785484
single my dear to be sure	446.46920630475455
What a fine thing for our girls How so	2525.580331332133
how can it affect them My dear Mr Bennet replied his wife how can you be so tiresome	428.1332398719392
You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them Is that his design in settling here Design	187.38174228603845
nonsense how can you talk so	467.77333731233347
But it is very likely that he fall in love with one of them and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes I see no occasion for that	36.51741272548377
You and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them Mr Bingley might like you the best of the party My dear you flatter me	12.91549665014884
I certainly had my share of beauty but I do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now	428.1332398719392
When a woman has five grown up daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty In such cases a woman has not often much beauty to think of But my dear you must indeed go and see Mr Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood It is more than I engage for I assure you But consider your daughters	6.218001087320917
Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them	3462.6068336021035
Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no new comers	121.15276586285881
Indeed you must go for it will be impossible for to visit him if you do not You are over scrupulous surely	149.24955450518294
I dare say Mr Bingley will be very glad to see you and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy I desire you will do no such thing	7.038135554931555
Lizzy is not a bit better than the others and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane nor half so good humoured as Lydia	52.983169062837085
But you are always giving the preference They have none of them much to recommend them replied he they are all silly and ignorant like other girls but Lizzy has something more of quickness than her sisters Mr Bennet how can you abuse your own children in such a way	9.55855309468529
You take delight in vexing me	627.2367209905697
I have a high respect for your nerves	1622.5957823643093
They are my old friends	289.3073146308603
you do not know what I suffer But I hope you will get over it and live to see many young men of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood It will be no use to us if twenty such should come since you will not visit them Depend upon it my dear that when there are twenty I will visit them all Mr Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character	3.2374575428176438
mind was less difficult to develope	627.2367209905697
She was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper	5125.616880269244
When she was discontented she fancied herself nervous	1655.8735216287728
CHAPTER II	1.284857555844875
Mr Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr Bingley	3727.5937203149383
He had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it	24.484367468222267
It was then disclosed in the following manner	1557.854041141138
She has two nieces of her own	891.4838872153653
She is a selfish hypocritical woman and I have no opinion of her No more have I said Mr Bennet and I am glad to find that you do not depend on her serving you Mrs Bennet deigned not to make any reply but unable to contain herself began scolding one of her daughters	8.11130830789687
Dont keep coughing so Kitty for heavens sake	1760.060344050462
Have a little compassion on my nerves	1046.3393929311092
You tear them to pieces Kitty has no discretion in her coughs said her father she times them ill I do not cough for my own amusement replied Kitty fretfully	41.011270705513006
A fortnights acquaintance is certainly very little	1120.6900652727268
But if do not venture somebody else will and after all Mrs Long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office I will take it on myself The girls stared at their father	10.481131341546856
Mrs Bennet said only Nonsense nonsense What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he	599.4842503189408
Do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense	599.4842503189408
I cannot quite agree with you	627.2367209905697
What say you Mary	87.7319564626089
for you are a young lady of deep reflection I know and read great books and make extracts Mary wished to say something very sensible but knew not how	46.415888336127786
While Mary is adjusting her ideas he continued let us return to Mr Bingley I am sick of Mr Bingley cried his wife	121.15276586285881
I am sorry to hear but why did not you tell me so before	2154.4346900318833
If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not have called on him	873.3261623828432
How good it was in you my dear Mr Bennet	2563.989412659125
But I knew I should persuade you at last	2262.8745249117715
Well how pleased I am	289.3073146308603
and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now Now Kitty you may cough as much as you chuse said Mr Bennet and as he spoke he left the room fatigued with the raptures of his wife	8.778013135972484
What an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shut	2154.4346900318833
At our time of life it is not so pleasant I can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but for your sakes we would do any thing	41.011270705513006
Lydia my love though you the youngest I dare say Mr Bingley will dance with you at the next ball Oh said Lydia stoutly I am not afraid for though I the youngest Im the tallest The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he would return Mr Bennets visit and determining when they should ask him to dinner	6.218001087320917
CHAPTER III	1.284857555844875
Not all that Mrs Bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of Mr Bingley	36.51741272548377
They attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the second hand intelligence of their neighbour Lady Lucas	17.782794100389232
Her report was highly favourable	289.3073146308603
Sir William had been delighted with him	1046.3393929311092
He was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party	83.76776400682921
Nothing could be more delightful	256.084676093353
To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of Mr Bingleys heart were entertained	121.15276586285881
He had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father	61.05402296585327
The ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse	52.983169062837085
An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had Mrs Bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all	32.74549162877729
Mr Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation c	149.24955450518294
Mrs Bennet was quite disconcerted	177.25824547375356
Lady Lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to London only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that Mr Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly	11.006941712522094
The girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought only six with him from London his five sisters and a cousin	19.14481976169958
Mr Bingley was good looking and gentleman like he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners	599.4842503189408
His sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion	3503.542088374543
His brother in law Mr Hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend Mr Darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year	8.778013135972484
The gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than Mr Bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in Derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend	3.4485331776221058
Mr Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at Netherfield	17.782794100389232
Such amiable qualities must speak for themselves	1046.3393929311092
What a contrast between him and his friend	1417.7137660480676
Mr Darcy danced only once with Mrs Hurst and once with Miss Bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party	16.57723885589317
He was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and every body hoped that he would never come there again	187.38174228603845
Come Darcy said he I must have you dance	2210.7655309685183
I hate to see you standing about by yourself in this stupid manner	3727.5937203149383
You had much better dance I certainly shall not	2262.8745249117715
You know how I detest it unless I am particularly acquainted with my partner	2154.4346900318833
Your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with I would not be so fastidious as you are cried Bingley for a kingdom	16.57723885589317
Upon my honour I never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as I have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room said Mr Darcy looking at the eldest Miss Bennet	10.481131341546856
Oh	1.2848575558448747
she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld	2236.668281301835
Do let me ask my partner to introduce you Which do you mean and turning round he looked for a moment at Elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said She is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt and I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men	6.042963902381328
You had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me Mr Bingley followed his advice	100.00000000000001
Mr Darcy walked off and Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him	2154.4346900318833
She told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in any thing ridiculous	100.00000000000001
The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family	3111.5279445715732
Mrs Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield party	3727.5937203149383
Mr Bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters	1333.521432163324
Jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way	599.4842503189408
Elizabeth felt Janes pleasure	97.91709669801119
Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball	13.68874509537081
They returned therefore in good spirits to Longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants	187.38174228603845
They found Mr Bennet still up	627.2367209905697
With a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations	29.552092352028872
He had rather hoped that all his wifes views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear	52.983169062837085
Oh	1.2848575558448747
I wish you had been there	397.0653824864233
Jane was so admired nothing could be like it	2390.6215493862082
Every body said how well she looked and Mr Bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice	316.227766016838
Only think of my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time	71.09709432312432
First of all he asked Miss Lucas	1120.6900652727268
I was so vexed to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going down the dance	17.782794100389232
So he enquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next	873.3261623828432
Then the two third he danced with Miss King and the two fourth with Maria Lucas and the two fifth with Jane again and the two sixth with Lizzy and the Boulanger If he had had any compassion for cried her husband impatiently he would not have danced half so much	9.152473108773892
For Gods sake say no more of his partners	2032.9424477302039
Oh	1.2848575558448747
that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance Oh	3217.4548914408424
my dear continued Mrs Bennet I am quite delighted with him	3041.3231721312036
He is so excessively handsome	289.3073146308603
and his sisters are charming women	547.2418975491341
I never in my life saw any thing more elegant than their dresses	3727.5937203149383
I dare say the lace upon Mrs Hursts gown Here she was interrupted again	2154.4346900318833
So high and so conceited that there was no enduring him	3327.5577123947423
He walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great	5346.783134922081
Not handsome enough to dance with	460.0536407275059
I wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your set downs	599.4842503189408
I quite detest the man CHAPTER IV	1120.6900652727268
He is just what a young man ought to be said she sensible good humoured lively and I never saw such happy manners so much ease with such perfect good breeding He is also handsome replied Elizabeth which a young man ought likewise to be if he possibly can	10.0
His character is thereby complete I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time	316.227766016838
did for you	19.280007499081826
But that is one great difference between us	1634.5799516636096
What could be more natural than his asking you again	2873.554391106136
He could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room	240.40991835099712
No thanks to his gallantry for that	1120.6900652727268
Well he certainly is very agreeable and I give you leave to like him	2154.4346900318833
You have liked many a stupider person Dear Lizzy Oh	3393.7481503500094
you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general	2154.4346900318833
All the world are good and agreeable in your eyes	3393.7481503500094
I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life I would wish not to be hasty in censuring any one but I always speak what I think I know you do and it is which makes the wonder	14.547578108480476
With good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others	1333.521432163324
Affectation of candour is common enough one meets it every where	4341.218347705809
But to be candid without ostentation or design to take the good of every bodys character and make it still better and say nothing of the bad belongs to you alone	36.51741272548377
And so you like this mans sisters too do you	3393.7481503500094
Their manners are not equal to his Certainly not at first	3863.9604807431015
But they are very pleasing women when you converse with them	4341.218347705809
Miss Bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her Elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them	4.003221666659723
They were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it but proud and conceited	36.51741272548377
They were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others	7.53690398089854
They were of a respectable family in the north of England a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been acquired by trade	32.74549162877729
Mr Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly an hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it Mr Bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at Netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase	3.4485331776221058
Mr Bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House	149.24955450518294
He did look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately	26.826957952797255
Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of a great opposition of character Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the easiness openness ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied	9.152473108773892
On the strength of Darcys regard Bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion	428.1332398719392
In understanding Darcy was the superior	627.2367209905697
Bingley was by no means deficient but Darcy was clever	2297.7149532319263
In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage	2390.6215493862082
Bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared Darcy was continually giving offence	2154.4346900318833
Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much	4913.599025871819
Mrs Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so but still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of	20.691380811147894
Miss Bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose	100.00000000000001
CHAPTER V	1.284857555844875
The distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly	1760.060344050462
It had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from Meryton denominated from that period Lucas Lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world	5.575305334261898
For though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to every body	149.24955450518294
By nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at St	2921.683600052908
Jamess had made him courteous	264.0029742293326
The eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twenty seven was Elizabeths intimate friend	873.3261623828432
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate	26.826957952797255
were Mr Bingleys first choice Yes but he seemed to like his second better Oh you mean Jane I suppose because he danced with her twice	71.09709432312432
Mr Robinsons asking him how he liked our Meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and he thought the prettiest	36.51741272548377
and his answering immediately to the last question Oh	2221.9042328698197
the eldest Miss Bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point Upon my word Well that was very decided indeed that does seem as if but however it may all come to nothing you know overhearings were more to the purpose than Eliza said Charlotte	10.0
Mrs Long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips Are you quite sure Maam is not there a little mistake said Jane I certainly saw Mr Darcy speaking to her Aye because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield and he could not help answering her but she said he seemed very angry at being spoke to Miss Bingley told me said Jane that he never speaks much unless among his intimate acquaintance	3.6998304144069647
With he is remarkably agreeable I do not believe a word of it my dear	1333.521432163324
If he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to Mrs Long	2154.4346900318833
But I can guess how it was every body says that he is ate up with pride and I dare say he had heard somehow that Mrs Long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise I do not mind his not talking to Mrs Long said Miss Lucas but I wish he had danced with Eliza Another time Lizzy said her mother I would not dance with if I were you I believe Maam I may safely promise you to dance with him His pride said Miss Lucas does not offend so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it	2.7699879264343568
One cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune every thing in his favour should think highly of himself	121.15276586285881
If I may so express it he has a to be proud That is very true replied Elizabeth and I could easily forgive pride if he had not mortified Pride observed Mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing I believe	10.481131341546856
By all that I have ever read I am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of self complacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary	8.778013135972484
Vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonimously	3727.5937203149383
CHAPTER VI	1.284857555844875
The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield	3393.7481503500094
The visit was returned in due form	1120.6900652727268
Miss Bennets pleasing manners grew on the good will of Mrs Hurst and Miss Bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with was expressed towards the two eldest	12.216773489967919
By Jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but Elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of every body hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to Jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration	7.813707376518094
It was generally evident whenever they met that he admire her and to it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since Jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent	3.4485331776221058
It may perhaps be pleasant replied Charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded	41.011270705513006
If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark	17.782794100389232
There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself	149.24955450518294
We can all freely a slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement	52.983169062837085
In nine cases out of ten a woman had better shew affection than she feels	1333.521432163324
Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on But she does help him on as much as her nature will allow	26.826957952797255
If can perceive her regard for him he must be a simpleton indeed not to discover it too Remember Eliza that he does not know Janes disposition as you do But if a woman is partial to a man and does not endeavour to conceal it he must find it out Perhaps he must if he sees enough of her	6.601948484081891
But though Bingley and Jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together	19.14481976169958
Jane should therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his attention	599.4842503189408
But these are not Janes feelings she is not acting by design	5079.894397423908
As yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness	428.1332398719392
She danced four dances with him at Meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times	61.05402296585327
This is not quite enough to make her understand his character Not as you represent it	873.3261623828432
Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance	2295.539085361908
They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life You make me laugh Charlotte but it is not sound	10.481131341546856
You know it is not sound and that you would never act in this way yourself Occupied in observing Mr Bingleys attentions to her sister Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend	11.583232862547103
Mr Darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise	29.552092352028872
But no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes	15.505157798326243
Though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness	8.431909292866257
Of this she was perfectly unaware to her he was only the man who made himself agreeable no where and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with	41.011270705513006
He began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others	100.00000000000001
His doing so drew her notice	627.2367209905697
It was at Sir William Lucass where a large party were assembled	4720.083570262617
He has a very satirical eye and if I do not begin by being impertinent myself I shall soon grow afraid of him On his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said Did not you think Mr Darcy that I expressed myself uncommonly well just now when I was teazing Colonel Forster to give us a ball at Meryton With great energy but it is a subject which always makes a lady energetic You are severe on us It will be turn soon to be teazed said Miss Lucas	2.589543080585877
I am going to open the instrument Eliza and you know what follows You are a very strange creature by way of a friend always wanting me to play and sing before any body and every body If my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is I would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers On Miss Lucass persevering however she added Very well if it must be so it must And gravely glancing at Mr Darcy There is a fine old saying which every body here is of course familiar with Keep your breath to cool your porridge and I shall keep mine to swell my song Her performance was pleasing though by no means capital	2.303132058706997
After a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister Mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display	7.813707376518094
Mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached	20.691380811147894
Elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and Mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the Lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room	5.4361836201538365
Mr Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas was his neighbour till Sir William thus began	12.216773489967919
What a charming amusement for young people this is Mr Darcy There is nothing like dancing after all I consider it as one of the first refinements of polished societies Certainly Sir and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst the less polished societies of the world Every savage can dance Sir William only smiled	7.038135554931555
Your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing Bingley join the group and I doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself Mr Darcy You saw me dance at Meryton I believe Sir Yes indeed and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight	10.0
Do you often dance at St	627.2367209905697
Jamess Never sir Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it You have a house in town I conclude Mr Darcy bowed	13.68874509537081
I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself for I am fond of superior society but I did not feel quite certain that the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas He paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her My dear Miss Eliza why are not you dancing Mr Darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner You cannot refuse to dance I am sure when so much beauty is before you And taking her hand he would have given it to Mr Darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to Sir William Indeed Sir I have not the least intention of dancing I entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner Mr Darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain	1.788649529057435
Elizabeth was determined nor did Sir William at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion	599.4842503189408
You excel so much in the dance Miss Eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection I am sure to oblige us for one half hour Mr Darcy is all politeness said Elizabeth smiling	8.431909292866257
He is indeed but considering the inducement my dear Miss Eliza we cannot wonder at his complaisance for who would object to such a partner Elizabeth looked archly and turned away	36.51741272548377
Her resistance had not injured her with the gentleman and he was thinking of her with some complacency when thus accosted by Miss Bingley I can guess the subject of your reverie I should imagine not You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this manner in such society and indeed I am quite of your opinion	6.218001087320917
I was never more annoyed	236.27987617727499
The insipidity and yet the noise the nothingness and yet the self importance of all these people What would I give to hear your strictures on them Your conjecture is totally wrong I assure you	24.484367468222267
My mind was more agreeably engaged	627.2367209905697
I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face and desired he would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections	10.481131341546856
Mr Darcy replied with great intrepidity Miss Elizabeth Bennet Miss Elizabeth Bennet repeated Miss Bingley	1333.521432163324
A ladys imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment	316.227766016838
I knew you would be wishing me joy Nay if you are so serious about it I shall consider the matter as absolutely settled	100.00000000000001
You will have a charming mother in law indeed and of course she will be always at Pemberley with you He listened to her with perfect indifference while she chose to entertain herself in this manner and as his composure convinced her that all was safe her wit flowed long	9.55855309468529
CHAPTER VII	1.284857555844875
Her father had been an attorney in Meryton and had left her four thousand pounds	1333.521432163324
She had a sister married to a Mr Philips who had been a clerk to their father and succeeded him in the business and a brother settled in London in a respectable line of trade	24.484367468222267
At present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and Meryton was the head quarters	22.456979955397745
Their visits to Mrs Philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence	3727.5937203149383
Every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections	3727.5937203149383
Their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves	599.4842503189408
Mr Philips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before	599.4842503189408
They could talk of nothing but officers and Mr Bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign	26.826957952797255
After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject Mr Bennet coolly observed From all that I can collect by your manner of talking you must be two of the silliest girls in the country	22.456979955397745
I have suspected it some time but I am now convinced Catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but Lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to London	8.778013135972484
If I wished to think slightingly of any bodys children it should not be of my own however If my children are silly I must hope to be always sensible of it Yes but as it happens they are all of them very clever This is the only point I flatter myself on which we do not agree	7.038135554931555
I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but I must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish My dear Mr Bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother When they get to our age I dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do	5.575305334261898
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well and indeed so I do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him and I thought Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir Williams in his regimentals Mama cried Lydia my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watsons as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in Clarkes library Mrs Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for Miss Bennet it came from Netherfield and the servant waited for an answer	2.4081270125596355
what is it about	97.91709669801119
what does he say	78.60625410999789
Well Jane make haste and tell us make haste my love It is from Miss Bingley said Jane and then read it aloud	121.15276586285881
My dear Friend If you are not so compassionate as to dine to day with Louisa and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole days tête à tête between two women can never end without a quarrel	10.0
My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officers	3588.110416120387
Yours ever CAROLINE BINGLEY With the officers cried Lydia	2525.580331332133
but the gentlemen will have Mr Bingleys chaise to go to Meryton and the Hursts have no horses to theirs I had much rather go in the coach But my dear your father cannot spare the horses I am sure	16.57723885589317
They are wanted in the farm Mr Bennet are not they They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them But if you have got them to day said Elizabeth my mothers purpose will be answered She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged	7.813707376518094
Her hopes were answered Jane had not been gone long before it rained hard	2154.4346900318833
Her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted	4084.357217789265
The rain continued the whole evening without intermission Jane certainly could not come back	2154.4346900318833
This was a lucky idea of mine indeed said Mrs Bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own	71.09709432312432
Till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance	873.3261623828432
Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield brought the following note for Elizabeth My dearest Lizzy I FIND myself very unwell this morning which I suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday	19.14481976169958
They insist also on my seeing Mr Jones therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to me and excepting a sore throat and head ache there is not much the matter with me	17.782794100389232
Yours c Well my dear said Mr Bennet when Elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness if she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of Mr Bingley and under your orders Oh	9.55855309468529
I am not at all afraid of her dying	1540.422010474138
People do not die of little trifling colds	1760.060344050462
She will be taken good care of	1022.712713897267
I would go and see her if I could have the carriage Elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horse woman walking was her only alternative	14.547578108480476
She declared her resolution	97.91709669801119
How can you be so silly cried her mother as to think of such a thing in all this dirt	240.40991835099712
You will not be fit to be seen when you get there I shall be very fit to see Jane which is all I want Is this a hint to me Lizzy said her father to send for the horses No indeed	14.547578108480476
I do not wish to avoid the walk	1004.9354770903943
The distance is nothing when one has a motive only three miles	5346.783134922081
I shall be back by dinner I admire the activity of your benevolence observed Mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required We will go as far as Meryton with you said Catherine and Lydia Elizabeth accepted their company and the three young ladies set off together	5.878016072274914
If we make haste said Lydia as they walked along perhaps we may see something of Captain Carter before he goes In Meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives and Elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ancles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise	3.75588809068008
She was shewn into the breakfast parlour where all but Jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to Mrs Hurst and Miss Bingley and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it	6.042963902381328
She was received however very politely by them and in their brothers manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindness Mr Darcy said very little and Mr Hurst nothing at all	22.456979955397745
The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone	52.983169062837085
The latter was thinking only of his breakfast	1655.8735216287728
Miss Bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room	316.227766016838
She was not equal however to much conversation and when Miss Bingley left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with	41.011270705513006
Elizabeth silently attended her	97.91709669801119
When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and Elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they shewed for Jane	46.415888336127786
The advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely	1333.521432163324
When the clock struck three Elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so	873.3261623828432
Miss Bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when Jane testified such concern in parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the present	11.006941712522094
Elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes	83.76776400682921
CHAPTER VIII	1.284857555844875
At five oclock the two ladies retired to dress and at half past six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner	316.227766016838
To the civil enquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr Bingleys she could not make a very favourable answer	32.74549162877729
Jane was by no means better	367.56098437685756
His anxiety for Jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others	32.74549162877729
She had very little notice from any but him	2390.6215493862082
Her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty	83.76776400682921
I shall never forget her appearance this morning	1470.0129935990064
She really looked almost wild She did indeed Louisa	2390.6215493862082
I could hardly keep my countenance	536.151591419881
Very nonsensical to come at all	579.9085843097012
Why must be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold	3727.5937203149383
Her hair so untidy so blowsy Yes and her petticoat I hope you saw her petticoat six inches deep in mud I am absolutely certain and the gown which had been let down to hide it not doing its office Your picture may be very exact Louisa said Bingley but this was all lost upon me	7.53690398089854
Her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice observed it Mr Darcy I am sure said Miss Bingley and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see make such an exhibition Certainly not To walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ancles in dirt and alone quite alone	6.812920690579612
what could she mean by it	627.2367209905697
It seems to me to shew an abominable sort of conceited independence a most country town indifference to decorum It shews an affection for her sister that is very pleasing said Bingley	32.74549162877729
I am afraid Mr Darcy observed Miss Bingley in a half whisper that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine eyes Not at all he replied they were brightened by the exercise A short pause followed this speech and Mrs Hurst began again	11.583232862547103
I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet she is really a very sweet girl and I wish with all my heart she were well settled	71.09709432312432
But with such a father and mother and such low connections I am afraid there is no chance of it I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in Meryton Yes and they have another who lives somewhere near Cheapside That is capital added her sister and they both laughed heartily	7.53690398089854
If they had uncles enough to fill Cheapside cried Bingley it would not make them one jot less agreeable But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any consideration in the world replied Darcy	19.14481976169958
To this speech Bingley made no answer but his sisters gave it their hearty assent and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of their dear friends vulgar relations	36.51741272548377
With a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the dining parlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee	100.00000000000001
She was still very poorly and Elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go down stairs herself	12.91549665014884
On entering the drawing room she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book	9.152473108773892
Mr Hurst looked at her with astonishment	751.2692958365793
Do you prefer reading to cards said he that is rather singular Miss Eliza Bennet said Miss Bingley despises cards	240.40991835099712
She is a great reader and has no pleasure in anything else I deserve neither such praise nor such censure cried Elizabeth I am a great reader and I have pleasure in many things In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure said Bingley and I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well Elizabeth thanked him from her heart and then walked towards a table where a few books were lying	4.3754793750741845
He immediately offered to fetch her others all that his library afforded	5125.616880269244
I am astonished said Miss Bingley that my father should have left so small a collection of books What a delightful library you have at Pemberley Mr Darcy It ought to be good he replied it has been the work of many generations And then you have added so much to it yourself you are always buying books I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as these Neglect	4.738879609717654
I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of that noble place	873.3261623828432
Charles when you build house I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley I wish it may But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that neighbourhood and take Pemberley for a kind of model	16.57723885589317
There is not a finer county in England than Derbyshire With all my heart I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will sell it I am talking of possibilities Charles Upon my word Caroline I should think it more possible to get Pemberley by purchase than by imitation Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the card table and stationed herself between Mr Bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game	3.4485331776221058
Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring said Miss Bingley will she be as tall as I am I think she will	121.15276586285881
She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennets height or rather taller How I long to see her again	428.1332398719392
I never met with anybody who delighted me so much	3020.6580511248785
Such a countenance such manners	289.3073146308603
My dear Charles what do you mean Yes all of them I think	3727.5937203149383
They all paint tables cover skreens and net purses	2525.580331332133
The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a skreen	149.24955450518294
I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished Nor I I am sure said Miss Bingley	46.415888336127786
Then observed Elizabeth you must comprehend a great deal in your idea of an accomplished woman Yes I do comprehend a great deal in it Oh	71.09709432312432
certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with	149.24955450518294
I rather wonder now at your knowing Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all this never saw such a woman	52.983169062837085
As all conversation was thereby at an end Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room	2154.4346900318833
Eliza Bennet said Miss Bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men I dare say it succeeds	16.57723885589317
But in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art Undoubtedly replied Darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation	20.691380811147894
Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her	316.227766016838
Bingley urged Mr Joness being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians	29.552092352028872
This she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal and it was settled that Mr Jones should be sent for early in the morning if Miss Bennet were not decidedly better	16.57723885589317
Bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable	3727.036224945224
They solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister	17.782794100389232
CHAPTER IX	1.284857555844875
Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from Mr Bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters	8.11130830789687
In spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to Longbourn desiring her mother to visit Jane and form her own judgment of her situation	46.415888336127786
The note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with	5125.616880269244
Mrs Bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast	1333.521432163324
Had she found Jane in any apparent danger Mrs Bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield	11.583232862547103
She would not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable	52.983169062837085
Bingley met them with hopes that Mrs Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected	599.4842503189408
Indeed I have Sir was her answer	976.9214157645
She is a great deal too ill to be moved	2041.82112662393
It must not be thought of	564.9677109337
I am sure she added if it was not for such good friends I do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper I ever met with	6.601948484081891
I often tell my other girls they are nothing to	3228.475297332962
You have a sweet room here Mr Bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk	873.3261623828432
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to Netherfield	2154.4346900318833
You will not think of quitting it in a hurry I hope though you have but a short lease Whatever I do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if I should resolve to quit Netherfield I should probably be off in five minutes	11.583232862547103
At present however I consider myself as quite fixed here That is exactly what I should have supposed of you said Elizabeth	149.24955450518294
You begin to comprehend me do you cried he turning towards her	5125.616880269244
Oh	1.2848575558448747
yes I understand you perfectly I wish I might take this for a compliment but to be so easily seen through I am afraid is pitiful That is as it happens	36.51741272548377
It does not necessarily follow that a deep intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours Lizzy cried her mother remember where you are and do not run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home I did not know before continued Bingley immediately that you were a studier of character	6.40400427119728
It must be an amusing study Yes but intricate characters are the amusing	3727.5937203149383
I assure you there is quite as much of going on in the country as in town Every body was surprised and Darcy after looking at her for a moment turned silently away	29.552092352028872
Mrs Bennet who fancied she had gained a complete victory over him continued her triumph	1333.521432163324
I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country for my part except the shops and public places	187.38174228603845
The country is a vast deal pleasanter is not it Mr Bingley When I am in the country he replied I never wish to leave it and when I am in town it is pretty much the same	19.14481976169958
They have each their advantages and I can be equally happy in either Aye that is because you have the right disposition	149.24955450518294
You quite mistook Mr Darcy	289.3073146308603
He only meant that there were not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true Certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood I believe there are few neighbourhoods larger	8.11130830789687
His sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards Mr Darcy with a very expressive smile	599.4842503189408
Elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since coming away	71.09709432312432
Yes she called yesterday with her father	1031.2143746216375
What an agreeable man Sir William is Mr Bingley is not he	4626.689667912174
so much the man of fashion	570.3383117851288
I fancy she was wanted about the mince pies	2525.580331332133
For my part Mr Bingley always keep servants that can do their own work daughters are brought up differently	316.227766016838
But every body is to judge for themselves and the Lucases are very good sort of girls I assure you	240.40991835099712
It is a pity they are not handsome	1160.1458066332307
dear yes but you must own she is very plain	2911.238610013387
I do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure Jane one does not often see any body better looking	100.00000000000001
It is what every body says	536.151591419881
I do not trust my own partiality	730.5579184495987
When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother Gardiners in town so much in love with her that my sister in law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away	19.14481976169958
But however he did not	177.5669737690073
However he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were And so ended his affection said Elizabeth impatiently	240.40991835099712
There has been many a one I fancy overcome in the same way	3727.5937203149383
I wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love I have been used to consider poetry as the of love said Darcy	71.09709432312432
Of a fine stout healthy love it may	1760.060344050462
But if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away Darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again	13.68874509537081
She longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence Mrs Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr Bingley for his kindness to Jane with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy	17.782794100389232
She performed her part indeed without much graciousness but Mrs Bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage	316.227766016838
Upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward	3829.76906463376
Lydia was a stout well grown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and good humoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age	29.552092352028872
She had high animal spirits and a sort of natural self consequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance	24.484367468222267
She was very equal therefore to address Mr Bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it	16.57723885589317
His answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear	5125.616880269244
I am perfectly ready I assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball	46.415888336127786
But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill Lydia declared herself satisfied	873.3261623828432
Oh	1.2848575558448747
yes it would be much better to wait till Jane was well and by that time most likely Captain Carter would be at Meryton again	83.76776400682921
And when you have given ball she added I shall insist on their giving one also	873.3261623828432
I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not Mrs Bennet and her daughters then departed and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr Darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of in spite of all Miss Bingleys witticisms on	5.179474679231211
The day passed much as the day before had done	2755.2577244670983
Mrs Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room	29.552092352028872
The loo table however did not appear	941.0595171310952
Mr Darcy was writing and Miss Bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister	52.983169062837085
Mr Hurst and Mr Bingley were at piquet and Mrs Hurst was observing their game	1333.521432163324
Elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion	316.227766016838
How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter He made no answer	1333.521432163324
You write uncommonly fast You are mistaken	1046.3393929311092
Letters of business too	97.91709669801119
How odious I should think them It is fortunate then that they fall to my lot instead of to yours Pray tell your sister that I long to see her I have already told her so once by your desire I am afraid you do not like your pen	10.0
Let me mend it for you	627.2367209905697
Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and I think it infinitely superior to Miss Grantleys Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again At present I have not room to do them justice Oh	5.575305334261898
I shall see her in January	536.151591419881
But do you always write such charming long letters to her Mr Darcy They are generally long but whether always charming it is not for me to determine It is a rule with me that a person who can write a long letter with ease cannot write ill That will not do for a compliment to Darcy Caroline cried her brother because he does write with ease	5.4361836201538365
He studies too much for words of four syllables Do not you Darcy My style of writing is very different from yours Oh cried Miss Bingley Charles writes in the most careless way imaginable	26.826957952797255
He leaves out half his words and blots the rest My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them by which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents Your humility Mr Bingley said Elizabeth must disarm reproof Nothing is more deceitful said Darcy than the appearance of humility	7.2789538439831505
It is often only carelessness of opinion and sometimes an indirect boast And which of the two do you call little recent piece of modesty The indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting	6.042963902381328
The power of doing any thing with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance	71.09709432312432
When you told Mrs Bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourself and yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else Nay cried Bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning	3.6998304144069647
And yet upon my honour I believed what I said of myself to be true and I believe it at this moment	149.24955450518294
Your conduct would be quite as dependant on chance as that of any man I know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say Bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not go and at another word might stay a month You have only proved by this cried Elizabeth that Mr Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition	4.641588833612779
You have shewn him off now much more than he did himself I am exceedingly gratified said Bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper	26.826957952797255
But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as I could Would Mr Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it Upon my word I cannot exactly explain the matter Darcy must speak for himself You expect me to account for opinions which you chuse to call mine but which I have never acknowledged	3.0916909765830884
Allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember Miss Bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety To yield readily easily to the of a friend is no merit with you To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of either You appear to me Mr Darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection	3.495250132675474
A regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it	121.15276586285881
I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about Mr Bingley	873.3261623828432
But in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it Will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties By all means cried Bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument Miss Bennet than you may be aware of	2.5694257109482446
I assure you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself I should not pay him half so much deference	71.09709432312432
I declare I do not know a more aweful object than Darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a Sunday evening when he has nothing to do Mr Darcy smiled but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh	8.11130830789687
Miss Bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense	316.227766016838
I see your design Bingley said his friend You dislike an argument and want to silence this Perhaps I do	240.40991835099712
Arguments are too much like disputes	579.9085843097012
If you and Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room I shall be very thankful and then you may say whatever you like of me What you ask said Elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and Mr Darcy had much better finish his letter Mr Darcy took her advice and did finish his letter	6.601948484081891
When that business was over he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for the indulgence of some music	428.1332398719392
Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to the piano forte and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself	32.74549162877729
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange	24.484367468222267
She could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present	24.484367468222267
The supposition did not pain her	627.2367209905697
After playing some Italian songs Miss Bingley varied the charm by a lively Scotch air and soon afterwards Mr Darcy drawing near Elizabeth said to her Do not you feel a great inclination Miss Bennet to seize such an opportunity of dancing a reel She smiled but made no answer	9.55855309468529
He repeated the question with some surprise at her silence	3393.7481503500094
Oh said she I heard you before but I could not immediately determine what to say in reply	428.1332398719392
I hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers And if I may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses Have you any thing else to propose for my domestic felicity Oh	3.495250132675474
Put them next to your great uncle the judge	2525.580331332133
I did not know that you intended to walk said Miss Bingley in some confusion lest they had been overheard	240.40991835099712
The path just admitted three	289.3073146308603
We had better go into the avenue But Elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered No no stay where you are You are charmingly groupd and appear to uncommon advantage	22.456979955397745
The picturesque would be spoilt by admitting a fourth	2525.580331332133
Good bye She then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two	83.76776400682921
Jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening	316.227766016838
CHAPTER XI	1.284857555844875
When the ladies removed after dinner Elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared	7.038135554931555
But when the gentlemen entered Jane was no longer the first object	4501.983011148175
He was full of joy and attention	1120.6900652727268
The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fire place that she might be farther from the door	14.547578108480476
He then sat down by her and talked scarcely to any one else	3727.5937203149383
Elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight	3727.5937203149383
When tea was over Mr Hurst reminded his sister in law of the card table but in vain	428.1332398719392
She had obtained private intelligence that Mr Darcy did not wish for cards and Mr Hurst soon found even his open petition rejected	121.15276586285881
She assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her	121.15276586285881
Mr Hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sophas and go to sleep	240.40991835099712
Darcy took up a book Miss Bingley did the same and Mrs Hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with Miss Bennet	29.552092352028872
She could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on	599.4842503189408
I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading	2779.234549634386
How much sooner one tires of any thing than of a book When I have a house of my own I shall be miserable if I have not an excellent library No one made any reply	22.456979955397745
She then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said By the bye Charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at Netherfield I would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party I am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure If you mean Darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chuses before it begins but as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send round my cards I should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting	1.9843535278685567
Her figure was elegant and she walked well but Darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious	240.40991835099712
In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to Elizabeth said Miss Eliza Bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so long in one attitude Elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately	7.2789538439831505
Miss Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility Mr Darcy looked up	873.3261623828432
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book	121.15276586285881
she was dying to know what could be his meaning and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him	240.40991835099712
Not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it Miss Bingley however was incapable of disappointing Mr Darcy in any thing and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation of his two motives	8.11130830789687
I have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak	316.227766016838
You either chuse this method of passing the evening because you are in each others confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first I should be completely in your way and if the second I can admire you much better as I sit by the fire Oh	5.878016072274914
shocking cried Miss Bingley	85.71168360275243
How shall we punish him for such a speech Nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said Elizabeth	240.40991835099712
Teaze him laugh at him Intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done But upon my honour I do	100.00000000000001
No no I feel he may defy us there	2525.580331332133
And as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject	316.227766016838
Mr Darcy may hug himself Mr Darcy is not to be laughed at cried Elizabeth	1333.521432163324
That is an uncommon advantage and uncommon I hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to to have many such acquaintance	83.76776400682921
The wisest and the best of men nay the wisest and best of their actions may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke Certainly replied Elizabeth there are such people but I hope I am not one of	12.216773489967919
I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good	3228.475297332962
Follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies divert me I own and I laugh at them whenever I can But these I suppose are precisely what you are without Perhaps that is not possible for any one	22.456979955397745
But it has been the study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong understanding to ridicule Such as vanity and pride Yes vanity is a weakness indeed	32.74549162877729
But pride where there is a real superiority of mind pride will be always under good regulation Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile	100.00000000000001
Your examination of Mr Darcy is over I presume said Miss Bingley and pray what is the result I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr Darcy has no defect	41.011270705513006
He owns it himself without disguise No said Darcy I have made no such pretension	1333.521432163324
I have faults enough but they are not I hope of understanding	4409.228862488108
My temper I dare not vouch for It is I believe too little yielding certainly too little for the convenience of the world	121.15276586285881
I cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought nor their offences against myself	316.227766016838
My feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them	4710.351154021535
Implacable resentment a shade in a character	1120.6900652727268
But you have chosen your fault well I really cannot at it	5346.783134922081
You are safe from me There is I believe in every disposition a tendency to some particular evil a natural defect which not even the best education can overcome And defect is a propensity to hate every body And yours he replied with a smile is wilfully to misunderstand them Do let us have a little music cried Miss Bingley tired of a conversation in which she had no share Louisa you will not mind my waking Mr Hurst Her sister made not the smallest objection and the piano forte was opened and Darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it	2.99357729472049
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention	4913.599025871819
CHAPTER XII	1.284857555844875
In consequence of an agreement between the sisters Elizabeth wrote the next morning to her mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day	32.74549162877729
But Mrs Bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday which would exactly finish Janes week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before	32.74549162877729
Her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to Elizabeths wishes for she was impatient to get home	316.227766016838
Mrs Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before Tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if Mr Bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well Against staying longer however Elizabeth was positively resolved nor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged Jane to borrow Mr Bingleys carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made	3.0916909765830884
The communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on Jane and till the morrow their going was deferred	26.826957952797255
To Mr Darcy it was welcome intelligence Elizabeth had been at Netherfield long enough	2154.4346900318833
She attracted him more than he liked and Miss Bingley was uncivil to and more teazing than usual to himself	240.40991835099712
He wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it	9.152473108773892
Steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of Saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for half an hour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her	12.91549665014884
On Sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place	2154.4346900318833
Miss Bingleys civility to Elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for Jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the former Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest spirits	5.878016072274914
Mrs Bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure Jane would have caught cold again But their father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle	9.152473108773892
The evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth	71.09709432312432
CHAPTER XIII	1.284857555844875
I know of nobody that is coming I am sure unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in and I hope dinners are good enough for her	61.05402296585327
I do not believe she often sees such at home The person of whom I speak is a gentleman and a stranger Mrs Bennets eyes sparkled A gentleman and a stranger	36.51741272548377
It is Mr Bingley I am sure	497.8893592599069
Why Jane you never dropt a word of this you sly thing	5054.080905121878
how unlucky	1.284857555844875
there is not a bit of fish to be got to day	4579.788073374001
Lydia my love ring the bell	579.9085843097012
I must speak to Hill this moment It is Mr Bingley said her husband it is a person whom I never saw in the whole course of my life This roused a general astonishment and he had the pleasure of being eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once	9.152473108773892
It is from my cousin Mr Collins who when I am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases Oh	71.09709432312432
my dear cried his wife I cannot bear to hear that mentioned	3765.1761352778567
Pray do not talk of that odious man	1655.8735216287728
I do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and I am sure if I had been you I should have tried long ago to do something or other about it Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail	7.2789538439831505
They had often attempted it before but it was a subject on which Mrs Bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about	9.152473108773892
It certainly is a most iniquitous affair said Mr Bennet and nothing can clear Mr Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn	149.24955450518294
But if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself No that I am sure I shall not and I think it was very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical	11.006941712522094
I hate such false friends	289.3073146308603
Why could not he keep on quarrelling with you as his father did before him Why indeed he does seem to have had some filial scruples on that head as you will hear near Westerham Kent th October DEAR SIR The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since I have had the misfortune to lose him I have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with any one with whom it had always pleased him to be at variance There Mrs Bennet My mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at Easter I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh widow of Sir Lewis de Bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her Ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the Church of England	1.7347402280979394
As a clergyman moreover I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures of good will are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olive branch	4.641588833612779
I cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amends but of this hereafter	15.505157798326243
If you should have no objection to receive me into your house I propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family Monday November th by four oclock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the Saturday senight following which I can do without any inconvenience as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a Sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day	4.3754793750741845
I remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your well wisher and friend WILLIAM COLLINS At four oclock therefore we may expect this peace making gentleman said Mr Bennet as he folded up the letter	17.782794100389232
He seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again There is some sense in what he says about the girls however and if he is disposed to make them any amends I shall not be the person to discourage him Though it is difficult said Jane to guess in what way he can mean to make us the atonement he thinks our due the wish is certainly to his credit Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady Catherine and his kind intention of christening marrying and burying his parishioners whenever it were required	2.4757157946593416
He must be an oddity I think said she	2262.8745249117715
I have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse	3228.475297332962
There is a mixture of servility and self importance in his letter which promises well	1333.521432163324
I am impatient to see him In point of composition said Mary his letter does not seem defective	428.1332398719392
The idea of the olive branch perhaps is not wholly new yet I think it is well expressed To Catherine and Lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting	29.552092352028872
It was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour	24.484367468222267
As for their mother Mr Collinss letter had done away much of her ill will and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters	29.552092352028872
Mr Bennet indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and Mr Collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself	52.983169062837085
He was a tall heavy looking young man of five and twenty	4501.983011148175
He had not been long seated before he complimented Mrs Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage	7.038135554931555
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but Mrs Bennet who quarrelled with no compliments answered most readily You are very kind sir I am sure and I wish with all my heart it may prove so for else they will be destitute enough	9.55855309468529
Things are settled so oddly You allude perhaps to the entail of this estate Ah	1333.521432163324
It is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess	4425.069726846741
Not that I mean to find fault with for such things I know are all chance in this world	316.227766016838
There is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed I am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that I am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate	12.91549665014884
But I can assure the young ladies that I come prepared to admire them	2154.4346900318833
At present I will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted He was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other	46.415888336127786
They were not the only objects of Mr Collinss admiration	2815.849380749816
The hall the dining room and all its furniture were examined and praised and his commendation of every thing would have touched Mrs Bennets heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property	16.57723885589317
But here he was set right by Mrs Bennet who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen	20.691380811147894
He begged pardon for having displeased her	1120.6900652727268
CHAPTER XIV	1.284857555844875
During dinner Mr Bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness	11.006941712522094
Lady Catherine de Bourghs attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable	873.3261623828432
Mr Bennet could not have chosen better	718.5101287529297
Mr Collins was eloquent in her praise	796.8784691054008
The subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of rank such affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from Lady Catherine	11.583232862547103
She had been graciously pleased to approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her	149.24955450518294
She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings and had sent for him only the Saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening	46.415888336127786
She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations	12.91549665014884
She had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herself some shelves in the closets up stairs	7.2789538439831505
That is all very proper and civil I am sure said Mrs Bennet and I dare say she is a very agreeable woman	121.15276586285881
It is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her	2154.4346900318833
Does she live near you sir The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane from Rosings Park her ladyships residence I think you said she was a widow sir	24.484367468222267
has she any family She has one only daughter the heiress of Rosings and of very extensive property Ah cried Mrs Bennet shaking her head then she is better off than many girls	29.552092352028872
And what sort of young lady is she	1489.1627601779014
is she handsome She is a most charming young lady indeed	3360.3793459364083
Lady Catherine herself says that in point of true beauty Miss De Bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young woman of distinguished birth	20.691380811147894
She is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of as I am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them	14.547578108480476
But she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies Has she been presented	100.00000000000001
I do not remember her name among the ladies at court Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as I told Lady Catherine myself one day has deprived the British court of its brightest ornament	13.68874509537081
Her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies	41.011270705513006
I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her These are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay You judge very properly said Mr Bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy	3.9376589235643866
May I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible Mr Bennets expectations were fully answered	5.0608719869196825
His cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure	13.68874509537081
My aunt told me so herself on Saturday	1760.060344050462
I shall walk to Meryton to morrow to hear more about it and to ask when Mr Denny comes back from town Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue but Mr Collins much offended laid aside his book and said I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit	5.4361836201538365
It amazes me I confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction	599.4842503189408
Mr Bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements	240.40991835099712
Mrs Bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for Lydias interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would resume his book but Mr Collins after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no ill will and should never resent her behaviour as any affront seated himself at another table with Mr Bennet and prepared for backgammon	6.40400427119728
The subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the self conceit of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity	11.583232862547103
A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his rights as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness self importance and humility	5.179474679231211
Having now a good house and very sufficient income he intended to marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had a wife in view as he meant to chuse one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report	8.778013135972484
This was his plan of amends of atonement for inheriting their fathers estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part	26.826957952797255
His plan did not vary on seeing them Miss Bennets lovely face confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority and for the first evening was his settled choice	22.456979955397745
The next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an hours tête à tête with Mrs Bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonage house and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on As to her daughters she could not take upon her to say she could not positively answer but she did not of any prepossession her daughter she must just mention she felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged Mr Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth and it was soon done done while Mrs Bennet was stirring the fire	2.317199913684755
Elizabeth equally next to Jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course	3727.5937203149383
Lydias intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten every sister except Mary agreed to go with her and Mr Collins was to attend them at the request of Mr Bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither Mr Collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to Mr Bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at Hunsford	3.6998304144069647
Such doings discomposed Mr Bennet exceedingly	627.2367209905697
In pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered Meryton	187.38174228603845
The attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by	2154.4346900318833
Mr Denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend Mr Wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps	20.691380811147894
His appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best part of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address	83.76776400682921
The introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation a readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and Darcy and Bingley were seen riding down the street	8.11130830789687
On distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities	316.227766016838
Bingley was the principal spokesman and Miss Bennet the principal object	3727.117838991507
Mr Darcy corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and Elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting	8.11130830789687
Both changed colour one looked white the other red	2525.580331332133
Mr Wickham after a few moments touched his hat a salutation which Mr Darcy just deigned to return	428.1332398719392
What could be the meaning of it It was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know	240.40991835099712
In another minute Mr Bingley but without seeming to have noticed what passed took leave and rode on with his friend	187.38174228603845
Mr Denny and Mr Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of Mr Philipss house and then made their bows in spite of Miss Lydias pressing entreaties that they would come in and even in spite of Mrs Philips throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation	9.152473108773892
Mrs Philips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see Mr Joness shop boy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the Miss Bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards Mr Collins by Janes introduction of him	3.2769055017089728
She received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice	10.0
Mrs Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to by exclamations and inquiries about the other of whom however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that Mr Denny had brought him from London and that he was to have a lieutenants commission in the shire	5.878016072274914
She had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had Mr Wickham appeared Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid disagreeable fellows Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr Wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from Longbourn would come in the evening	3.2374575428176438
This was agreed to and Mrs Philips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards	52.983169062837085
The prospect of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits	1333.521432163324
Mr Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless	240.40991835099712
As they walked home Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen but though Jane would have defended either or both had they appeared to be wrong she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister	14.547578108480476
Mr Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs Bennet by admiring Mrs Philipss manners and politeness	873.3261623828432
He protested that except Lady Catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but had even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before	11.006941712522094
Something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life	52.983169062837085
CHAPTER XVI	1.284857555844875
As no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their aunt and all Mr Collinss scruples of leaving Mr and Mrs Bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to Meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawing room that Mr Wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in the house	4.3754793750741845
In describing to her all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her mansion with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them and he found in Mrs Philips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could	4.641588833612779
The officers of the shire were in general a very creditable gentleman like set and the best of them were of the present party but Mr Wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as were superior to the broad faced stuffy uncle Philips breathing port wine who followed them into the room	7.038135554931555
Mr Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night and on the probability of a rainy season made her feel that the commonest dullest most thread bare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker	4.460162165376301
With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr Wickham and the officers Mr Collins seemed likely to sink into insignificance to the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind listener in Mrs Philips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin	7.813707376518094
When the card tables were placed he had an opportunity of obliging her in return by sitting down to whist	240.40991835099712
I know little of the game at present said he but I shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation of life Mrs Philips was very thankful for his compliance but could not wait for his reason	17.782794100389232
At first there seemed danger of Lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for any one in particular	9.152473108773892
Allowing for the common demands of the game Mr Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to Elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told the history of his acquaintance with Mr Darcy	10.481131341546856
She dared not even mention that gentleman	1046.3393929311092
Mr Wickham began the subject himself	579.9085843097012
He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton and after receiving her answer asked in an hesitating manner how long Mr Darcy had been staying there	71.09709432312432
About a month said Elizabeth and then unwilling to let the subject drop added He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire I understand Yes replied Wickham his estate there is a noble one	22.456979955397745
A clear ten thousand per annum	627.2367209905697
You could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for I have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy Elizabeth could not but look surprised	15.505157798326243
I am not qualified to form one	795.0070812637317
I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge	2154.4346900318833
It is impossible for to be impartial	839.2862738804807
He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire	1465.5302470307113
Every body is disgusted with his pride	1120.6900652727268
The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chuses to be seen I should take him even on slight acquaintance to be an ill tempered man Wickham only shook his head	11.583232862547103
I wonder said he at the next opportunity of speaking whether he is likely to be in this country much longer I do not at all know but I nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield	17.782794100389232
If wishes to avoid seeing he must go	1760.060344050462
We are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but I have no reason for avoiding but what I might proclaim to all the world a sense of very great ill usage and most painful regrets at his being what he is	10.481131341546856
His father Miss Bennet the late Mr Darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend I ever had and I can never be in company with this Mr Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections	11.583232862547103
Mr Wickham began to speak on more general topics Meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter especially with gentle but very intelligible gallantry	22.456979955397745
It was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire	187.38174228603845
I knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend Denny tempted me farther by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them	22.456979955397745
Society I own is necessary to me	1120.6900652727268
I have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude	3727.5937203149383
I have employment and society	289.3073146308603
The church to have been my profession I was brought up for the church and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now Indeed Yes the late Mr Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift	7.038135554931555
He was my godfather and excessively attached to me	2254.0656830002868
He meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere Good heavens cried Elizabeth but how could be How could his will be disregarded Why did not you seek legal redress There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law	6.042963902381328
I have a warm unguarded temper and I may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion him and him too freely	240.40991835099712
But the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me This is quite shocking He deserves to be publicly disgraced Some time or other he be but it shall not be by	17.782794100389232
Till I can forget his father I can never defy or expose Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them	52.983169062837085
But what said she after a pause can have been his motive what can have induced him to behave so cruelly A thorough determined dislike of me a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy	17.782794100389232
Had the late Mr Darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommon attachment to me irritated him I believe very early in life	36.51741272548377
He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood the sort of preference which was often given me I had not thought Mr Darcy so bad as this though I have never liked him I had not thought so very ill of him I had supposed him to be despising his fellow creatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this After a few minutes reflection however she continued I remember his boasting one day at Netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper	2.9328491084381394
father began life in the profession which your uncle Mr Philips appears to do so much credit to but he gave up every thing to be of use to the late Mr Darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the Pemberley property	12.216773489967919
He was most highly esteemed by Mr Darcy a most intimate confidential friend	3727.5937203149383
Mr Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendance and when immediately before my fathers death Mr Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to as of affection to myself How strange cried Elizabeth	6.812920690579612
How abominable I wonder that the very pride of this Mr Darcy has not made him just to you If from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest for dishonesty I must call it It wonderful replied Wickham for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride has often been his best friend	6.042963902381328
It has connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling	4084.357217789265
But we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good Yes	32.74549162877729
It has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor	71.09709432312432
Not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the Pemberley House is a powerful motive	83.76776400682921
He has also pride which with brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy He shook his head I wish I could call her amiable	8.11130830789687
It gives me pain to speak ill of a Darcy	2588.635532889554
But she is too much like her brother very very proud As a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement	26.826957952797255
But she is nothing to me now	933.3011218517198
She is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and I understand highly accomplished	2154.4346900318833
Since her fathers death her home has been London where a lady lives with her and superintends her education After many pauses and many trials of other subjects Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first and saying I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr Bingley	10.0
How can they suit each other Do you know Mr Bingley Not at all He is a sweet tempered amiable charming man	149.24955450518294
He cannot know what Mr Darcy is Probably not but Mr Darcy can please where he chuses	599.4842503189408
He does not want abilities	264.0029742293326
He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while	3727.5937203149383
Among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous	100.00000000000001
His pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberal minded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeable allowing something for fortune and figure The whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and Mr Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs Philips The usual inquiries as to his success were made by the latter	5.722367659350217
I know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a card table they must take their chance of these things and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object	17.782794100389232
Lady Catherine de Bourgh she replied has very lately given him a living	3727.5937203149383
I hardly know how Mr Collins was first introduced to her notice but he certainly has not known her long You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr Darcy No indeed I did not I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherines connections	6.812920690579612
Vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already self destined to another	52.983169062837085
Mr Collins said she speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship I suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman I believe her to be both in a great degree replied Wickham I have not seen her for many years but I very well remember that I never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent	3.9376589235643866
She has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but I rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chuses that every one connected with him should have an understanding of the first class Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr Wickhams attentions	3.317671127842857
There could be no conversation in the noise of Mrs Philipss supper party but his manners recommended him to every body	187.38174228603845
Whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done gracefully	5346.783134922081
Elizabeth went away with her head full of him	2525.580331332133
She could think of nothing but of Mr Wickham and of what he had told her all the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither Lydia nor Mr Collins were once silent	12.91549665014884
Lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and Mr Collins in describing the civility of Mr and Mrs Philips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crouded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at Longbourn House	4.738879609717654
Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between Mr Wickham and herself	1333.521432163324
Interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other	2295.539085361908
It is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side Very true indeed and now my dear Jane what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business Do clear too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody Laugh as much as you chuse but you will not laugh me out of my opinion	4.071515547789689
My dearest Lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr Darcy to be treating his fathers favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for It is impossible	20.691380811147894
No man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it	316.227766016838
Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him	4341.218347705809
oh	1.2848575558448747
Besides there was truth in his looks It is difficult indeed it is distressing One does not know what to think I beg your pardon one knows exactly what to think But Jane could think with certainty on only one point that Mr Bingley if he imposed on would have much to suffer when the affair became public	7.038135554931555
The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom they had been speaking Mr Bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield which was fixed for the following Tuesday	8.431909292866257
To the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding Mrs Bennet as much as possible saying not much to Elizabeth and nothing at all to the others	46.415888336127786
They were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs Bennets civilities	41.011270705513006
The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family	1333.521432163324
Mrs Bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr Bingley himself instead of a ceremonious card	36.51741272548377
Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr Wickham and of seeing a confirmation of every thing in Mr Darcys looks and behaviour	11.006941712522094
The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like Elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with Mr Wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball	8.431909292866257
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it	2154.4346900318833
While I can have my mornings to myself said she it is enough I think it no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements	100.00000000000001
Society has claims on us all and I profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for every body Elizabeths spirits were so high on the occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr Collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr Bingleys invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh by venturing to dance	2.7953009456081994
I am by no means of opinion I assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and I am so far from objecting to dancing myself that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours Miss Elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in	2.903775007273507
She had fully proposed being engaged by Wickham for those very dances and to have Mr Collins instead	428.1332398719392
her liveliness had been never worse timed	1120.6900652727268
There was no help for it however	954.8622169161257
The idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was exceedingly agreeable to	6.40400427119728
Elizabeth however did not chuse to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply	121.15276586285881
If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once	7.813707376518094
No aunt no officers no news could be sought after the very shoe roses for Netherfield were got by proxy	240.40991835099712
Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with Mr Wickham and nothing less than a dance on Tuesday could have made such a Friday Saturday Sunday and Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia	11.583232862547103
CHAPTER XVIII	1.284857555844875
Till Elizabeth entered the drawing room at Netherfield and looked in vain for Mr Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her	26.826957952797255
The certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her	187.38174228603845
She had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening	15.505157798326243
But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr Darcys pleasure in the Bingleys invitation to the officers and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr Denny to whom Lydia eagerly applied and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here This part of his intelligence though unheard by Lydia was caught by Elizabeth and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make Attention forbearance patience with Darcy was injury to Wickham	1.9025216559384015
She was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of ill humour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to Mr Bingley whose blind partiality provoked her	22.456979955397745
But Elizabeth was not formed for ill humour and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice	5.179474679231211
The two first dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification	1333.521432163324
Mr Collins awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give	22.456979955397745
She danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of Wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked	149.24955450518294
When those dances were over she returned to Charlotte Lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr Darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him	11.006941712522094
He walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind Charlotte tried to console her	100.00000000000001
I dare say you will find him very agreeable Heaven forbid would be the greatest misfortune of all To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate Do not wish me such an evil When the dancing recommenced however and Darcy approached to claim her hand Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence	3.874675120456131
They stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance	6.812920690579612
He replied and was again silent	627.2367209905697
One must speak a little you know	1120.6900652727268
How near it may be to I cannot pretend to say think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly I must not decide on my own performance He made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton	7.2789538439831505
She answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added When you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance The effect was immediate	32.74549162877729
I have been most highly gratified indeed my dear Sir	2456.279023980724
It is evident that you belong to the first circles	3071.2511016511903
What congratulations will then flow in	627.2367209905697
Recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said Sir Williams interruption has made me forget what we were talking of I do not think we were speaking at all	32.74549162877729
Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves We have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine What think you of books said he smiling	10.481131341546856
Books Oh	1.284857555844875
Yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming I remember hearing you once say Mr Darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable	11.583232862547103
You are very cautious I suppose as to its I am said he with a firm voice	599.4842503189408
And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice I hope not It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion to be secure of judging properly at first May I ask to what these questions tend Merely to the illustration of character said she endeavouring to shake off her gravity	8.431909292866257
I am trying to make it out And what is your success She shook her head	873.3261623828432
I do not get on at all	730.5579184495987
I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly I can readily believe answered he gravely that report may vary greatly with respect to me and I could wish Miss Bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either But if I do not take your likeness now I may never have another opportunity I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied	3.6458412370707323
They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her So Miss Eliza I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham Your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and I find that the young man forgot to tell you among his other communications that he was the son of old Wickham the late Mr Darcys steward	4.460162165376301
Let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to Mr Darcys using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has been always remarkably kind to him though George Wickham has treated Mr Darcy in a most infamous manner	8.431909292866257
I do not know the particulars but I know very well that Mr Darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear George Wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way	5.878016072274914
His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and I wonder how he could presume to do it	121.15276586285881
I pity you Miss Eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said Elizabeth angrily for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr Darcys steward and of I can assure you he informed me himself I beg your pardon replied Miss Bingley turning away with a sneer	4.142704447847673
Excuse my interference It was kindly meant Insolent girl said Elizabeth to herself You are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this	41.011270705513006
I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr Darcy She then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley	26.826957952797255
I want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sisters what you have learnt about Mr Wickham	149.24955450518294
But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon No replied Jane I have not forgotten him but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you	16.57723885589317
Mr Bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended Mr Darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that Mr Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr Darcy than he has received and I am sorry to say that by his account as well as his sisters Mr Wickham is by no means a respectable young man	4.003221666659723
I am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose Mr Darcys regard Mr Bingley does not know Mr Wickham himself No he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton This account then is what he has received from Mr Darcy	11.583232862547103
I am perfectly satisfied	69.88252286880807
But what does he say of the living He does not exactly recollect the circumstances though he has heard them from Mr Darcy more than once but he believes that it was left to him only I have not a doubt of Mr Bingleys sincerity said Elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only	6.812920690579612
Mr Bingleys defence of his friend was a very able one I dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself I shall venture still to think of both gentlemen as I did before She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment	5.30441727984393
Elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of Bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it	52.983169062837085
I have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness	121.15276586285881
I happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of this house the names of his cousin Miss de Bourgh and of her mother Lady Catherine	29.552092352028872
Who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly I am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which I am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before	7.53690398089854
My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr Darcy Indeed I am	121.15276586285881
I shall intreat his pardon for not having done it earlier	3784.3015707929035
I believe him to be Lady Catherines	797.7433318271233
It will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday senight Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that Mr Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to Mr Darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance Mr Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus My dear Miss Elizabeth I have the highest opinion in the world of your excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained	1.7939366666643688
Pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr Darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident	4.3754793750741845
Her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology Hunsford and Lady Catherine de Bourgh It vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man	7.813707376518094
Mr Collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and Mr Darcys contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way	16.57723885589317
Mr Collins then returned to Elizabeth	627.2367209905697
Mr Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention	1526.5461786045162
He answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherines discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily	22.456979955397745
It was really a very handsome thought	912.1088807579196
Upon the whole I am much pleased with him As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr Bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane	8.431909292866257
She saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like Bingleys two sisters	20.691380811147894
Her mothers thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much	83.76776400682921
When they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person Lady Lucas freely openly and of nothing else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr Bingley It was an animating subject and Mrs Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match	4.294487988789274
His being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of self gratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do	7.2789538439831505
It was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as Janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked	5.722367659350217
It was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than Mrs Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life	15.505157798326243
She concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it	83.76776400682921
In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr Darcy who sat opposite to them	10.481131341546856
Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical	1760.060344050462
What is Mr Darcy to me pray that I should be afraid of him	2154.4346900318833
I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing may not like to hear For heavens sake madam speak lower What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr Darcy You will never recommend yourself to his friend by so doing Nothing that she could say however had any influence	6.812920690579612
Her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone	4710.114013967571
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation	2390.6215493862082
The expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity	873.3261623828432
At length however Mrs Bennet had no more to say and Lady Lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken	16.57723885589317
Elizabeth now began to revive	289.3073146308603
But not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing Mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company	26.826957952797255
By many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain Mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song	17.782794100389232
Marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected Elizabeth was in agonies	121.15276586285881
She looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at Darcy who continued however impenetrably grave	100.00000000000001
He took the hint and when Mary had finished her second song said aloud That will do extremely well child	240.40991835099712
You have delighted us long enough	627.2367209905697
Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit Mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and Elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her fathers speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good Others of the party were now applied to	12.216773489967919
If I said Mr Collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing I should have great pleasure I am sure in obliging the company with an air for I consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman I do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to	4.294487988789274
The rector of a parish has much to do In the first place he must make such an agreement for tythes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron	29.552092352028872
He must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible	17.782794100389232
And I do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards every body especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment	46.415888336127786
To Elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed	4.142704447847673
That his two sisters and Mr Darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable	14.547578108480476
The rest of the evening brought her little amusement	1657.6719144976196
In vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room	100.00000000000001
There was no arguing upon such a project	1622.5957823643093
She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas who often joined them and good naturedly engaged Mr Collinss conversation to herself	121.15276586285881
She was at least free from the offence of Mr Darcys farther notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak	32.74549162877729
She felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to Mr Wickham and rejoiced in it	428.1332398719392
The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a manoeuvre of Mrs Bennet had to wait for their carriages a quarter of an hour after every body else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family	8.431909292866257
They repulsed every attempt of Mrs Bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of Mr Collins who was complimenting Mr Bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests	6.812920690579612
Mr Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other	316.227766016838
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs Hurst or Miss Bingley and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of Lord how tired I am accompanied by a violent yawn	19.14481976169958
When at length they arose to take leave Mrs Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn and addressed herself particularly to Mr Bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation	7.038135554931555
Bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from London whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time	22.456979955397745
Mrs Bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four months	13.68874509537081
Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for the worth of each was eclipsed by Mr Bingley and Netherfield	26.826957952797255
CHAPTER XIX	1.284857555844875
The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn	2525.580331332133
Mr Collins made his declaration in form	1120.6900652727268
Having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business	7.038135554931555
On finding Mrs Bennet Elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words May I hope Madam for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the course of this morning Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise Mrs Bennet instantly answered Oh dear Yes certainly I am sure Lizzy will be very happy I am sure she can have no objection Come Kitty I want you up stairs And gathering her work together she was hastening away when Elizabeth called out Dear Maam do not go I beg you will not go Mr Collins must excuse me He can have nothing to say to me that any body need not hear	2.289350193638287
I am going away myself No no nonsense Lizzy I desire you will stay where you are And upon Elizabeths seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added Lizzy I upon your staying and hearing Mr Collins Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction and a moments consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion	3.4485331776221058
Mrs Bennet and Kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone Mr Collins began	873.3261623828432
Believe me my dear Miss Elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections	149.24955450518294
You would have been less amiable in my eyes had there been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that I have your respected mothers permission for this address	36.51741272548377
You can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken	61.05402296585327
Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life	316.227766016838
But before I am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for marrying and moreover for coming into Hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as I certainly did The idea of Mr Collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther and he continued My reasons for marrying are first that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish	2.697953640073
Secondly that I am convinced it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdly which perhaps I ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling patroness	12.91549665014884
Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject and it was but the very Saturday night before I left Hunsford between our pools at quadrille while Mrs Jenkinson was arranging Miss de Bourghs foot stool that she said Mr Collins you must marry	10.0
A clergyman like you must marry Chuse properly chuse a gentlewoman for sake and for your let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way	16.57723885589317
This is my advice	97.91709669801119
Find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to Hunsford and I will visit her	428.1332398719392
Allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that I do not reckon the notice and kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer	22.456979955397745
This has been my motive my fair cousin and I flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem	240.40991835099712
And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection	187.38174228603845
which will not be yours till after your mothers decease is all that you may ever be entitled to	316.227766016838
On that head therefore I shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now	24.484367468222267
You are too hasty Sir she cried	1031.2143746216375
You forget that I have made no answer	997.8330165594099
Let me do it without farther loss of time	2262.8745249117715
I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long Upon my word Sir cried Elizabeth your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration	16.57723885589317
I am perfectly serious in my refusal You could not make happy and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make so Nay were your friend Lady Catherine to know me I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so said Mr Collins very gravely but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you	4.142704447847673
And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualifications Indeed Mr Collins all praise of me will be unnecessary	16.57723885589317
You must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what I say	316.227766016838
I wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise	121.15276586285881
In making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of Longbourn estate whenever it falls without any self reproach	29.552092352028872
This matter may be considered therefore as finally settled And rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had not Mr Collins thus addressed her When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character Really Mr Collins cried Elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly	2.493592004984159
My reasons for believing it are briefly these It does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy your acceptance or that the establishment I can offer would be any other than highly desirable	24.484367468222267
My situation in life my connections with the family of De Bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into farther consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you	7.813707376518094
Your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications	187.38174228603845
As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females I do assure you Sir that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man	6.40400427119728
I would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere	4009.109184602398
I thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible	121.15276586285881
My feelings in every respect forbid it	953.6168117627972
Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart You are uniformly charming cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and I am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable To such perseverance in wilful self deception Elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female	2.4757157946593416
CHAPTER XX	1.284857555844875
Mr Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for Mrs Bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfast room and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection	5.0608719869196825
Mr Collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character	7.038135554931555
This information however startled Mrs Bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not to believe it and could not help saying so	15.505157798326243
But depend upon it Mr Collins she added that Lizzy shall be brought to reason	1333.521432163324
I will speak to her about it myself directly	2262.8745249117715
She is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but I will her know it Pardon me for interrupting you Madam cried Mr Collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state	5.878016072274914
If therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity Sir you quite misunderstand me said Mrs Bennet alarmed	12.216773489967919
Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these	2141.953885092933
I will go directly to Mr Bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her I am sure She would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library Oh	15.505157798326243
Mr Bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar	4869.767824200445
You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr Collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have Mr Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered and fixed them on her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by her communication	6.042963902381328
I have not the pleasure of understanding you said he when she had finished her speech	873.3261623828432
Of what are you talking Of Mr Collins and Lizzy	2557.5904497931997
Lizzy declares she will not have Mr Collins and Mr Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy And what am I to do on the occasion It seems an hopeless business Speak to Lizzy about it yourself	16.57723885589317
She shall hear my opinion Mrs Bennet rang the bell and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the library	428.1332398719392
I have sent for you on an affair of importance	3393.7481503500094
I understand that Mr Collins has made you an offer of marriage	3715.5467506254395
Is it true Elizabeth replied that it was	1307.1052546506764
Very well and this offer of marriage you have refused I have Sir Very well	1333.521432163324
We now come to the point	479.47026343970583
Your mother insists upon your accepting it	1120.6900652727268
Is not it so Mrs Bennet Yes or I will never see her again An unhappy alternative is before you Elizabeth	187.38174228603845
From this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents Your mother will never see you again if you do marry Mr Collins and I will never see you again if you Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but Mrs Bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed	5.4361836201538365
What do you mean Mr Bennet by talking in this way	3274.497166585116
You promised me to upon her marrying him My dear replied her husband I have two small favours to request	240.40991835099712
First that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room	187.38174228603845
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be Not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did Mrs Bennet give up the point	29.552092352028872
She endeavoured to secure Jane in her interest but Jane with all possible mildness declined interfering and Elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks	36.51741272548377
Though her manner varied however her determination never did	2525.580331332133
Mr Collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed	3682.668170637427
He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way	52.983169062837085
His regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret	187.38174228603845
While the family were in this confusion Charlotte Lucas came to spend the day with them	873.3261623828432
She was met in the vestibule by Lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper I am glad you are come for there is such fun here What do you think has happened this morning Mr Collins has made an offer to Lizzy and she will not have him Charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by Kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfast room where Mrs Bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family	2.697953640073
Pray do my dear Miss Lucas she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me I am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves Charlottes reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth	12.91549665014884
Aye there she comes continued Mrs Bennet looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at York provided she can have her own way But I tell you what Miss Lizzy if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at all and I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead shall not be able to keep you and so I warn you I have done with you from this very day I told you in the library you know that I should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word	2.4081270125596355
People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking	873.3261623828432
Those who do not complain are never pitied Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation	36.51741272548377
She talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr Collins who entered with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls Now I do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let Mr Collins and me have a little conversation together Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room Jane and Kitty followed but Lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and Charlotte detained first by the civility of Mr Collins whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear	2.5694257109482446
Mr Collins My dear Madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point	873.3261623828432
Far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter	149.24955450518294
Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I have been in early preferment and I trust I am resigned	24.484367468222267
Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for I have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation	10.481131341546856
My conduct may I fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughters lips instead of your own	240.40991835099712
But we are all liable to error	962.7998464150355
I have certainly meant well through the whole affair	2236.6682813018356
My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my has been at all reprehensible I here beg leave to apologise CHAPTER XXI	20.691380811147894
The discussion of Mr Collinss offer was now nearly at an end and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother	26.826957952797255
As for the gentleman himself feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence	52.983169062837085
He scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend	11.006941712522094
The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs Bennets ill humour or ill health	3727.5937203149383
Mr Collins was also in the same state of angry pride	3155.7921789732086
Elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it	149.24955450518294
He was always to have gone on Saturday and to Saturday he still meant to stay	873.3261623828432
He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of every body was well talked over To Elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence been self imposed	12.91549665014884
I found said he as the time drew near that I had better not meet Mr Darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than I could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself She highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her	3.1992671377973836
His accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother	32.74549162877729
Soon after their return a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet it came from Netherfield and was opened immediately	316.227766016838
Jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from Wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs	7.038135554931555
The whole party have left Netherfield by this time and are on their way to town and without any intention of coming back again	100.00000000000001
You shall hear what she says She then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street where Mr Hurst had a house	11.583232862547103
The next was in these words	579.9085843097012
I do not pretend to regret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of the delightful intercourse we have known and in the mean while may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence	7.2789538439831505
I depend on you for that To these high flown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr Bingleys being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his	4.3754793750741845
It is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country	100.00000000000001
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters Mr Bingley will not be detained in London by them Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter	5.4361836201538365
Many of my acquaintance are already there for the winter I wish I could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one in the croud but of that I despair	26.826957952797255
I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you It is evident by this added Jane that he comes back no more this winter It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he Why will you think so	4.840960141478948
It must be his own doing He is his own master	4084.357217789265
I read you the passage which particularly hurts me	2525.580331332133
I will have no reserves from Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth are scarcely less eager to meet her again	61.05402296585327
I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being hereafter our sister	12.91549665014884
I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but I will not leave the country without confiding them and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable	24.484367468222267
My brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sisters partiality is not misleading me I think when I call Charles most capable of engaging any womans heart	8.778013135972484
With all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am I wrong my dearest Jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many What think you of sentence my dear Lizzy said Jane as she finished it	10.481131341546856
Is it not clear enough Does it not expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to put me on my guard	8.778013135972484
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy	428.1332398719392
She follows him to town in the hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you Jane shook her head	52.983169062837085
Indeed Jane you ought to believe me No one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection	316.227766016838
Miss Bingley I am sure cannot	275.96166577153326
She is not such a simpleton	564.9677109337
Could she have seen half as much love in Mr Darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes	240.40991835099712
But the case is this	289.3073146308603
We are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and I dare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way	5.878016072274914
But my dearest Jane you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend If we thought alike of Miss Bingley replied Jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy	3.75588809068008
But I know the foundation is unjust	1120.6900652727268
Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one and all that I can hope in this case is that she is deceived herself That is right You could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine	13.68874509537081
Believe her to be deceived by all means	1346.7103845607803
You have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer But my dear sister can I be happy even supposing the best in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere You must decide for yourself said Elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife I advise you by all means to refuse him How can you talk so said Jane faintly smiling You must know that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation I could not hesitate I did not think you would and that being the case I cannot consider your situation with much compassion But if he returns no more this winter my choice will never be required	2.2496381902251934
A thousand things may arise in six months The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt	187.38174228603845
Janes temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that Bingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart	26.826957952797255
They agreed that Mrs Bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together	6.601948484081891
After lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation of thinking that Mr Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses	7.813707376518094
CHAPTER XXII	1.284857555844875
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her	953.6168117627972
It keeps him in good humour said she and I am more obliged to you than I can express Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time	14.547578108480476
This was very amiable but Charlottes kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of its object was nothing less than to secure her from any return of Mr Collinss addresses by engaging them towards herself	22.456979955397745
But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her feet	16.57723885589317
He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success could be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday	5.4361836201538365
In as short a time as Mr Collinss long speeches would allow every thing was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be waved for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness	5.4361836201538365
The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and Miss Lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained	10.0
Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity	187.38174228603845
Mr Collinss present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair	46.415888336127786
Lady Lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer Mr Bennet was likely to live and Sir William gave it as his decided opinion that whenever Mr Collins should be in possession of the Longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St	5.878016072274914
Jamess	1.2848575558448747
The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion	3855.1198616873567
The younger girls formed hopes of a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of Charlottes dying an old maid	36.51741272548377
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed	289.3073146308603
She had gained her point and had time to consider of it	5054.080905121878
Her reflections were in general satisfactory	579.9085843097012
Mr Collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary	149.24955450518294
This preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twenty seven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it	71.09709432312432
The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person	71.09709432312432
Elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such disapprobation	83.76776400682921
She resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged Mr Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family	29.552092352028872
A promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great self denial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love	6.218001087320917
As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leave taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and Mrs Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them	6.218001087320917
Risk any thing rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which I should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that shall take no offence Believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire	3.814128748283214
As for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin Elizabeth With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return	8.11130830789687
Mrs Bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him	41.011270705513006
But on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away	3727.5937203149383
The possibility of Mr Collinss fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out Engaged to Mr Collins	5.179474679231211
my dear Charlotte impossible The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied Why should you be surprised my dear Eliza Do you think it incredible that Mr Collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you But Elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness	2.5497879539629253
I never was	19.280007499081826
I ask only a comfortable home and considering Mr Collinss character connections and situation in life I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state Elizabeth quietly answered Undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family	7.53690398089854
Charlotte did not stay much longer and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard	428.1332398719392
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match	316.227766016838
The strangeness of Mr Collinss making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted	149.24955450518294
She had always felt that Charlottes opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she could not have supposed it possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage	19.14481976169958
Charlotte the wife of Mr Collins was a most humiliating picture And to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen	11.006941712522094
Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she were authorised to mention it when Sir William Lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family	16.57723885589317
With many compliments to them and much self gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matter to an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for Mrs Bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and Lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed Good Lord	7.813707376518094
In the first place she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that Mr Collins had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together and fourthly that the match might be broken off	12.91549665014884
Nothing could console and nothing appease her Nor did that day wear out her resentment	1333.521432163324
A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter	15.505157798326243
Mr Bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that Charlotte Lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter	7.2789538439831505
Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable	26.826957952797255
Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on Mrs Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though Mrs Bennets sour looks and ill natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away	7.53690398089854
Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again	41.011270705513006
Her disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as Bingley had now been gone a week and nothing was heard of his return	9.152473108773892
Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again	121.15276586285881
The promised letter of thanks from Mr Collins arrived on Tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonths abode in the family might have prompted	29.552092352028872
After discharging his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour Miss Lucas and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight for Lady Catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men	2.631286073895943
Mr Collinss return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to Mrs Bennet	1333.521432163324
On the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband It was very strange that he should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome She hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable	6.601948484081891
Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject	2190.1441171626598
Day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to Netherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed Mrs Bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood	10.0
Even Elizabeth began to fear not that Bingley was indifferent but that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away	187.38174228603845
The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of London might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment	20.691380811147894
As for Jane anxiety under this suspence was of course more painful than Elizabeths but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing and between herself and Elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded to	24.484367468222267
It needed all Janes steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity	3727.5937203149383
Mr Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight but his reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction	61.05402296585327
The chief of every day was spent by him at Lucas Lodge and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed	26.826957952797255
The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her	2525.580331332133
Whenever Charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr Collins was convinced that they were talking of the Longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr Bennet were dead	7.53690398089854
She complained bitterly of all this to her husband	2019.523175409536
Indeed Mr Bennet said she it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house that I should be forced to make way for and live to see her take my place in it My dear do not give way to such gloomy thoughts	9.55855309468529
Let us hope for better things	579.9085843097012
Let us flatter ourselves that may be the survivor This was not very consoling to Mrs Bennet and therefore instead of making any answer she went on as before I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate	15.505157798326243

PRIDE PREJUDICE	1.284857555844875
CHAPTER I	1.284857555844875
Miss Bingleys letter arrived and put an end to doubt	2683.4843538529376
Hope was over entirely over and when Jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort	32.74549162877729
Miss Darcys praise occupied the chief of it	1364.2538958263328
Her many attractions were again dwelt on and Caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter	32.74549162877729
She wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an inmate of Mr Darcys house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture	41.011270705513006
Elizabeth to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation	599.4842503189408
To Carolines assertion of her brothers being partial to Miss Darcy she paid no credit	1333.521432163324
That he was really fond of Jane she doubted no more than she had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to the caprice of their inclinations	5.0608719869196825
Had his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in what ever manner he thought best but her sisters was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself	16.57723885589317
It was a subject in short on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing	599.4842503189408
She could think of nothing else and yet whether Bingleys regard had really died away or were suppressed by his friends interference whether he had been aware of Janes attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whichever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sisters situation remained the same her peace equally wounded	6.042963902381328
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth but at last on Mrs Bennets leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master she could not help saying Oh	14.547578108480476
that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him	71.09709432312432
He will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude but said nothing	100.00000000000001
You doubt me cried Jane slightly colouring indeed you have no reason	5054.080905121878
He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all	428.1332398719392
I have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with	2154.4346900318833
Thank God	1.284857555844875
A little time therefore I shall certainly try to get the better With a stronger voice she soon added I have this comfort immediately that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side and that it has done no harm to any one but myself My dear Jane exclaimed Elizabeth you are too good	6.812920690579612
Your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic I do not know what to say to you	873.3261623828432
Nay said Elizabeth this is not fair	962.7998464150356
wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if I speak ill of any body	599.4842503189408
only want to think perfect and you set yourself against it	4341.218347705809
Do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal good will	240.40991835099712
You need not	16.05622570038905
I have met with two instances lately one I will not mention the other is Charlottes marriage	599.4842503189408
It is unaccountable	19.280007499081826
in every view it is unaccountable My dear Lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these	428.1332398719392
You do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper	4777.4022530819975
Consider Mr Collinss respectability and Charlottes prudent steady character	2525.580331332133
Remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for every bodys sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin To oblige you I would try to believe almost any thing but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him I should only think worse of her understanding than I now do of her heart	3.5436477855785484
My dear Jane Mr Collins is a conceited pompous narrow minded silly man you know he is as well as I do and you must feel as well as I do that the woman who marries him cannot have a proper way of thinking	12.91549665014884
You shall not defend her though it is Charlotte Lucas	3071.2511016511903
You shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness I must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied Jane and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together	6.40400427119728
You alluded to something else	289.3073146308603
You mentioned instances	19.280007499081826
We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured	3207.0499304491127
We must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect	1333.521432163324
It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us	5079.894397423908
Women fancy admiration means more than it does And men take care that they should If it is designedly done they cannot be justified but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine I am far from attributing any part of Mr Bingleys conduct to design said Elizabeth but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery	4.3754793750741845
Thoughtlessness want of attention to other peoples feelings and want of resolution will do the business And do you impute it to either of those Yes to the last	46.415888336127786
But if I go on I shall displease you by saying what I think of persons you esteem	428.1332398719392
Stop me whilst you can You persist then in supposing his sisters influence him Yes in conjunction with his friend I cannot believe it	100.00000000000001
Why should they try to influence him	1046.3393929311092
They can only wish his happiness and if he is attached to me no other woman can secure it Your first position is false	100.00000000000001
They may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride Beyond a doubt they wish him to chuse Miss Darcy replied Jane but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing	6.812920690579612
They have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better	428.1332398719392
What sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable	873.3261623828432
If they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed	149.24955450518294
By supposing such an affection you make every body acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy	599.4842503189408
Do not distress me by the idea	976.9214157645
I am not ashamed of having been mistaken or at least it is slight it is nothing in comparison of what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters	32.74549162877729
Let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish and from this time Mr Bingleys name was scarcely ever mentioned between them	20.691380811147894
Mrs Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly there seemed little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity	16.57723885589317
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day	7.038135554931555
Mrs Bennets best comfort was that Mr Bingley must be down again in the summer	1333.521432163324
Mr Bennet treated the matter differently	627.2367209905697
So Lizzy said he one day your sister is crossed in love I find	2154.4346900318833
I congratulate her	19.280007499081826
Next to being married a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and then	599.4842503189408
It is something to think of and gives her a sort of distinction among her companions	873.3261623828432
When is your turn to come	579.9085843097012
Now is your time	97.91709669801119
Let Wickham be man	97.91709669801119
He is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably Thank you Sir but a less agreeable man would satisfy me	187.38174228603845
We must not all expect Janes good fortune True said Mr Bennet but it is a comfort to think that whatever of that kind may befal you you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it Mr Wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family	5.878016072274914
They saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve	873.3261623828432
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard his claims on Mr Darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and every body was pleased to think how much they had always disliked Mr Darcy before they had known any thing of the matter	8.778013135972484
Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of Hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakes but by everybody else Mr Darcy was condemned as the worst of men	8.778013135972484
CHAPTER II	1.284857555844875
After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity Mr Collins was called from his amiable Charlotte by the arrival of Saturday	83.76776400682921
He took leave of his relations at Longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks	41.011270705513006
On the following Monday Mrs Bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the Christmas at Longbourn	71.09709432312432
Mr Gardiner was a sensible gentleman like man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education	316.227766016838
The Netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so well bred and agreeable	36.51741272548377
Mrs Gardiner who was several years younger than Mrs Bennet and Mrs Philips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her Longbourn nieces	52.983169062837085
Between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a very particular regard	3727.5937203149383
They had frequently been staying with her in town	2362.9358734847483
The first part of Mrs Gardiners business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions	240.40991835099712
When this was done she had a less active part to play	4968.068478293794
It became her turn to listen	627.2367209905697
Mrs Bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of	4412.682388800926
They had all been very ill used since she last saw her sister	3727.5937203149383
Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage and after all there was nothing in it	316.227766016838
I do not blame Jane she continued for Jane would have got Mr Bingley if she could	599.4842503189408
But Lizzy	1.284857555844875
Oh sister	1.284857555844875
it is very hard to think that she might have been Mr Collinss wife by this time had not it been for her own perverseness	83.76776400682921
He made her an offer in this very room and she refused him	3727.5937203149383
The consequence of it is that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I have and that Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever	61.05402296585327
The Lucases are very artful people indeed sister	1655.8735216287728
They are all for what they can get	1760.060344050462
It makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else	71.09709432312432
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject	3494.4669611531053
It seems likely to have been a desirable match for Jane said she	3727.5937203149383
I am sorry it went off	458.2506786965285
But these things happen so often	627.2367209905697
A young man such as you describe Mr Bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent An excellent consolation in its way said Elizabeth but it will not do for	8.431909292866257
We do not suffer by	264.0029742293326
It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before But that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea	7.038135554931555
It is as often applied to feelings which arise from an half hours acquaintance as to a real strong attachment	240.40991835099712
Every time they met it was more decided and remarkable	3228.4752973329614
At his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and I spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer	52.983169062837085
Is not general incivility the very essence of love Oh yes of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt	121.15276586285881
I am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately	873.3261623828432
But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us	2154.4346900318833
Change of scene might be of service and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal and felt persuaded of her sisters ready acquiescence	24.484367468222267
I hope added Mrs Gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her	599.4842503189408
We live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her And is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and Mr Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London	4.641588833612779
My dear aunt how could you think of it	2092.629425960853
Mr Darcy may perhaps have of such a place as Gracechurch Street but he would hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it Mr Bingley never stirs without him So much the better	11.006941712522094
I hope they will not meet at all	1537.8209446592753
will not be able to help calling She will drop the acquaintance entirely But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of Bingleys being withheld from seeing Jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless	6.218001087320917
It was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be re animated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of Janes attractions	32.74549162877729
Miss Bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure and the Bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the time than as she hoped that by Carolines not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him	9.55855309468529
The Gardiners staid a week at Longbourn and what with the Philipses the Lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement	83.76776400682921
Mrs Bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner	83.76776400682921
When the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of it of which officers Mr Wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions Mrs Gardiner rendered suspicious by Elizabeths warm commendation of him narrowly observed them both	13.68874509537081
Without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment	8.778013135972484
To Mrs Gardiner Wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers	1333.521432163324
About ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of Derbyshire to which he belonged	71.09709432312432
They had therefore many acquaintance in common and though Wickham had been little there since the death of Darcys father five years before it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring	11.006941712522094
Mrs Gardiner had seen Pemberley and known the late Mr Darcy by character perfectly well	1333.521432163324
On being made acquainted with the present Mr Darcys treatment of him she tried to remember something of that gentlemans reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud ill natured boy	8.11130830789687
CHAPTER III	1.284857555844875
Mrs Gardiners caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on You are too sensible a girl Lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore I am not afraid of speaking openly	7.038135554931555
Seriously I would have you be on your guard	2262.8745249117715
Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent	149.24955450518294
But as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you	2154.4346900318833
You have sense and we all expect you to use it	4341.218347705809
Your father would depend on resolution and good conduct I am sure	4093.3437096568487
You must not disappoint your father My dear aunt this is being serious indeed Yes and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise Well then you need not be under any alarm	26.826957952797255
I will take care of myself and of Mr Wickham too	3282.4683808487134
I will try again	87.7319564626089
At present I am not in love with Mr Wickham no I certainly am not	1333.521432163324
But he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man I ever saw and if he becomes really attached to me I believe it will be better that he should not	36.51741272548377
I see the imprudence of it Oh	1022.712713897267
abominable Mr Darcy My fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honour and I should be miserable to forfeit it	187.38174228603845
My father however is partial to Mr Wickham	1526.5461786045162
In short my dear aunt I should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can I promise to be wiser than so many of my fellow creatures if I am tempted or how am I even to know that it would be wisdom to resist	4.142704447847673
All that I can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry	2154.4346900318833
I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object	3727.5937203149383
When I am in company with him I will not be wishing	2690.9724353364313
At least you should not your Mother of inviting him As I did the other day said Elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from	29.552092352028872
You know my mothers ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends	1333.521432163324
But really and upon my honour I will try to do what I think to be wisest and now I hope you are satisfied Her aunt assured her that she was and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented	7.038135554931555
Mr Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the Gardiners and Jane but as he took up his abode with the Lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs Bennet	24.484367468222267
His marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an ill natured tone that she they might be happy Thursday was to be the wedding day and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave Elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room	4.294487988789274
As they went down stairs together Charlotte said I shall depend on hearing from you very often Eliza you certainly shall And I have another favour to ask	52.983169062837085
Will you come and see me We shall often meet I hope in Hertfordshire I am not likely to leave Kent for some time	100.00000000000001
Promise me therefore to come to Hunsford Elizabeth could not refuse though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit	316.227766016838
My father and Maria are to come to me in March added Charlotte and I hope you will consent to be of the party	100.00000000000001
Indeed Eliza you will be as welcome to me as either of them The wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual	12.216773489967919
Elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible	61.05402296585327
Elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was	20.691380811147894
Charlottes first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like Lady Catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read Elizabeth felt that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen	5.878016072274914
She wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise	1333.521432163324
It was Mr Collinss picture of Hunsford and Rosings rationally softened and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest	61.05402296585327
Jane had already written a few lines to her sister to announce their safe arrival in London and when she wrote again Elizabeth hoped it would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys	22.456979955397745
Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is	2154.4346900318833
Jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from Caroline	2154.4346900318833
She accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been lost	149.24955450518294
My aunt she continued is going to morrow into that part of the town and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor street She wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen Miss Bingley	17.782794100389232
I was right therefore my last letter had never reached her	4341.218347705809
I enquired after their brother of course	1120.6900652727268
He was well but so much engaged with Mr Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him	873.3261623828432
I found that Miss Darcy was expected to dinner	2004.0145275309874
I wish I could see her	430.07446693200274
I dare say I shall soon see them here Elizabeth shook her head over this letter	873.3261623828432
It convinced her that accident only could discover to Mr Bingley her sisters being in town	873.3261623828432
Four weeks passed away and Jane saw nothing of him	3393.7481503500094
She endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to Miss Bingleys inattention	149.24955450518294
After waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no longer	11.583232862547103
My dearest Lizzy will I am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgment at my expence when I confess myself to have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingleys regard for me	29.552092352028872
But my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if I still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion	26.826957952797255
I do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again I am sure I should be deceived again	32.74549162877729
Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did I receive in the mean time	149.24955450518294
When she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer	6.812920690579612
I pity though I cannot help blaming her	1582.8602159467669
She was very wrong in singling me out as she did I can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side	100.00000000000001
But I pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because I am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it	41.011270705513006
I need not explain myself farther and though know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she may feel on his behalf is natural and amiable	9.152473108773892
I cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long long ago	52.983169062837085
He knows of my being in town I am certain from something she said herself and yet it should seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy	16.57723885589317
I cannot understand it	87.7319564626089
If I were not afraid of judging harshly I should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this	71.09709432312432
Let me hear from you very soon	976.9214157645
Miss Bingley said something of his never returning to Netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certainty	187.38174228603845
We had better not mention it	536.151591419881
I am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford	1333.521432163324
Pray go to see them with Sir William and Maria	2863.383429206367
I am sure you will be very comfortable there	1156.3379402778821
Yours c This letter gave Elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that Jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least	61.05402296585327
All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over	2390.6215493862082
His character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to Jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr Darcys sister as by Wickhams account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away	10.481131341546856
Mrs Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself	29.552092352028872
His apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else	599.4842503189408
Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain	240.40991835099712
Her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that would have been his only choice had fortune permitted it	83.76776400682921
The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable but Elizabeth less clear sighted perhaps in his case than in Charlottes did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence	11.583232862547103
Nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happy	13.68874509537081
All this was acknowledged to Mrs Gardiner and after relating the circumstances she thus went on I am now convinced my dear aunt that I have never been much in love for had I really experienced that pure and elevating passion I should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil	7.53690398089854
But my feelings are not only cordial towards they are even impartial towards Miss King	1333.521432163324
There can be no love in all this	1355.2017642447913
They are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain CHAPTER IV	26.826957952797255
March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford	1120.6900652727268
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither but Charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty	20.691380811147894
Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again and weakened her disgust of Mr Collins	873.3261623828432
The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay	61.05402296585327
Every thing however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to Charlottes first sketch	1333.521432163324
She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter	2880.675064656359
The only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter	15.505157798326243
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of every body would always coincide there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing	2.7213387683753076
Her fellow travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable	428.1332398719392
Sir William Lucas and his daughter Maria a good humoured girl but as empty headed as himself had nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise	15.505157798326243
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his information	121.15276586285881
As they drove to Mr Gardiners door Jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and Elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever	12.216773489967919
On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower	13.68874509537081
All was joy and kindness	289.3073146308603
The day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and shopping and the evening at one of the theatres	240.40991835099712
Their first subject was her sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute enquiries that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits there were periods of dejection	24.484367468222267
It was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long	4121.15497238399
Mrs Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingleys visit in Gracechurch street and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance	19.14481976169958
Mrs Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickhams desertion and complimented her on bearing it so well	599.4842503189408
But my dear Elizabeth she added what sort of girl is Miss King	3727.5937203149383
I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary Pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive	61.05402296585327
Where does discretion end and avarice begin	1120.6900652727268
I know no harm of her But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfathers death made her mistress of this fortune No why should he	52.983169062837085
If does not object to it why should not objecting does not justify	3727.5937203149383
It only shews her being deficient in something herself sense or feeling Well cried Elizabeth have it as you choose	240.40991835099712
shall be mercenary and shall be foolish No Lizzy that is what I do choose	1333.521432163324
I should be sorry you know to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire Oh	187.38174228603845
if that is all I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in Derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not much better	46.415888336127786
I am sick of them all	487.51577080564846
Thank Heaven	1.284857555844875
I am going to morrow where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him	71.09709432312432
Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all Take care Lizzy that speech savours strongly of disappointment Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer	7.813707376518094
We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us said Mrs Gardiner but perhaps to the Lakes No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful	17.782794100389232
My dear dear aunt she rapturously cried what delight	2347.3383439049167
what felicity	1.284857555844875
You give me fresh life and vigour	1120.6900652727268
Adieu to disappointment and spleen	289.3073146308603
What are men to rocks and mountains	1120.6900652727268
Oh	1.2848575558448747
what hours of transport we shall spend	1120.6900652727268
And when we return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing	149.24955450518294
We know where we have gone we recollect what we have seen	4475.230401795965
Lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarrelling about its relative situation	46.415888336127786
Let first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers CHAPTER V	1333.521432163324
When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford every eye was in search of the Parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view	52.983169062837085
The paling of Rosings Park was their boundary on one side	3772.0214140706903
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants	2154.4346900318833
At length the Parsonage was discernible	579.9085843097012
The garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge every thing declared they were arriving	100.00000000000001
In a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each other	599.4842503189408
Mrs Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received	83.76776400682921
She saw instantly that her cousins manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family	15.505157798326243
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him	10.0
But though every thing seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion	16.57723885589317
When Mr Collins said any thing of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on Charlotte	71.09709432312432
To work in his garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible	19.14481976169958
He could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump	187.38174228603845
From his garden Mr Collins would have led them round his two meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back and while Sir William accompanied him Charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of shewing it without her husbands help	6.812920690579612
It was rather small but well built and convenient and every thing was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit	41.011270705513006
When Mr Collins could be forgotten there was really a great air of comfort throughout and by Charlottes evident enjoyment of it Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten	46.415888336127786
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country	3970.8460245538968
It was spoken of again while they were at dinner when Mr Collins joining in observed Yes Miss Elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church and I need not say you will be delighted with her	11.006941712522094
She is all affability and condescension and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over	83.76776400682921
I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here	52.983169062837085
Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming	1634.5799516636096
We dine at Rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home	2154.4346900318833
I say one of her ladyships carriages for she has several Lady Catherine is a very respectable sensible woman indeed added Charlotte and a most attentive neighbour Very true my dear that is exactly what I say	20.691380811147894
She is the sort of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news and telling again what had been already written and when it closed Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlottes degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well	4.641588833612779
A lively imagination soon settled it all	1120.6900652727268
About the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her	9.55855309468529
She opened the door and met Maria in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried out Oh my dear Eliza	187.38174228603845
pray make haste and come into the dining room for there is such a sight to be seen	428.1332398719392
I will not tell you what it is	1151.6139261892495
Make haste and come down this moment Elizabeth asked questions in vain Maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the dining room which fronted the lane in quest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate	10.481131341546856
And is this all cried Elizabeth	627.2367209905697
I expected at least that the pigs were got into the garden and here is nothing but Lady Catherine and her daughter La	121.15276586285881
my dear said Maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not Lady Catherine	2154.4346900318833
The old lady is Mrs Jenkinson who lives with them	3393.7481503500094
The other is Miss De Bourgh	472.38883167190596
Only look at her	85.71168360275243
She is quite a little creature	579.9085843097012
Who would have thought she could be so thin and small She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind	83.76776400682921
Why does she not come in Oh	1046.3393929311092
Charlotte says she hardly ever does	627.2367209905697
It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in I like her appearance said Elizabeth struck with other ideas	149.24955450518294
She looks sickly and cross Yes she will do for him very well	3727.5937203149383
She will make him a very proper wife Mr Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and Sir William to Elizabeths high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way	8.431909292866257
Mr Collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day	19.14481976169958
CHAPTER VI	1.284857555844875
Mr Collinss triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete	3038.899449502187
The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of Lady Catherines condescension as he knew not how to admire enough	6.601948484081891
I confess said he that I should not have been at all surprised by her Ladyships asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at Rosings	46.415888336127786
But who could have foreseen such an attention as this	3038.8994495021866
Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival I am the less surprised at what has happened replied Sir William from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire	6.812920690579612
About the Court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to Rosings	52.983169062837085
Mr Collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them	36.51741272548377
When the ladies were separating for the toilette he said to Elizabeth Do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel	121.15276586285881
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and daughter	599.4842503189408
I would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest there is no occasion for any thing more	83.76776400682921
Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed	3727.5937203149383
She likes to have the distinction of rank preserved While they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at St	3.75588809068008
Jamess	1.2848575558448747
As the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park Every park has its beauty and its prospects and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as Mr Collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis De Bourgh	4.071515547789689
When they ascended the steps to the hall Marias alarm was every moment increasing and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm Elizabeths courage did not fail her	46.415888336127786
She had heard nothing of Lady Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money and rank she thought she could witness without trepidation	29.552092352028872
From the entrance hall of which Mr Collins pointed out with a rapturous air the fine proportion and finished ornaments they followed the servants through an anti chamber to the room where Lady Catherine her daughter and Mrs Jenkinson were sitting Her Ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them and as Mrs Collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary	3.6458412370707323
In spite of having been at St	954.8622169161257
Jamess Sir William was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look	7.813707376518094
Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her composedly Lady Catherine was a tall large woman with strongly marked features which might once have been handsome	26.826957952797255
Her air was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank	149.24955450518294
She was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her self importance and brought Mr Wickham immediately to Elizabeths mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented	9.55855309468529
When after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of Mr Darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in Marias astonishment at her being so thin and so small	15.505157798326243
Miss De Bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very little except in a low voice to Mrs Jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes	7.53690398089854
After sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view Mr Collins attending them to point out its beauties and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer	12.91549665014884
The dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which Mr Collins had promised and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her ladyships desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by Sir William who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son in law said in a manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear	3.1622776601683795
But Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them	71.09709432312432
The party did not supply much conversation	1120.6900652727268
Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between Charlotte and Miss De Bourgh the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady Catherine and the latter said not a word to her all dinner time	13.68874509537081
Mrs Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss De Bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she were indisposed	83.76776400682921
When the ladies returned to the drawing room there was little to be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgment controverted	8.431909292866257
She enquired into Charlottes domestic concerns familiarly and minutely and gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how every thing ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry	8.431909292866257
Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great Ladys attention which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others	187.38174228603845
In the intervals of her discourse with Mrs Collins she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and Elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to Mrs Collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl	11.583232862547103
She asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mothers maiden name Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly Lady Catherine then observed Your fathers estate is entailed on Mr Collins I think	4.3754793750741845
For your sake turning to Charlotte I am glad of it but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourghs family Do you play and sing Miss Bennet A little Oh	12.216773489967919
then some time or other we shall be happy to hear you	4364.170633543495
Our instrument is a capital one probably superior to You shall try it some day Do your sisters play and sing One of them does Why did not you all learn You ought all to have learned	20.691380811147894
The Miss Webbs all play and their father has not so good an income as yours Do you draw No not at all What none of you Not one That is very strange	29.552092352028872
But I suppose you had no opportunity	891.5131697341607
Your mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters My mother would have had no objection but my father hates London Has your governess left you We never had any governess No governess	17.782794100389232
How was that possible	97.91709669801119
Five daughters brought up at home without a governess I never heard of such a thing	873.3261623828432
Then who taught you	97.91709669801119
who attended to you	97.91709669801119
Without a governess you must have been neglected Compared with some families I believe we were but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means	52.983169062837085
I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it	100.00000000000001
It is wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that way	873.3261623828432
I am always glad to get a young person well placed out	4845.022090449283
Mrs Collins did I tell you of Lady Metcalfes calling yesterday to thank me	2154.4346900318833
She finds Miss Pope a treasure	627.2367209905697
Are any of your younger sisters out Miss Bennet Yes Maam all All What all five out at once	316.227766016838
Very odd And you only the second The younger ones out before the elder are married Your younger sisters must be very young Yes my youngest is not sixteen	46.415888336127786
Perhaps is full young to be much in company	2390.6215493862082
But really Maam I think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first	8.431909292866257
You cannot be more than twenty I am sure therefore you need not conceal your age I am not one and twenty When the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the card tables were placed	20.691380811147894
Their table was superlatively stupid	289.3073146308603
A great deal more passed at the other table	1874.9583053609956
Lady Catherine was generally speaking stating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself	428.1332398719392
Mr Collins was employed in agreeing to every thing her Ladyship said thanking her for every fish he won and apologising if he thought he won too many	52.983169062837085
He was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names	3393.7481503500094
When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose the tables were broke up the carriage was offered to Mrs Collins gratefully accepted and immediately ordered	41.011270705513006
The party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow	187.38174228603845
From these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr Collinss side and as many bows on Sir Williams they departed	36.51741272548377
But her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy Mr Collins and he was very soon obliged to take her Ladyships praise into his own hands	41.011270705513006
CHAPTER VII	1.284857555844875
Sir William staid only a week at Hunsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with	15.505157798326243
From the drawing room they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to Mr Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day	8.778013135972484
She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with Charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed on to get out	100.00000000000001
Now and then they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits	71.09709432312432
She examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that Mrs Collinss joints of meat were too large for her family	6.812920690579612
Elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace for the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by Mr Collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty	4.460162165376301
The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of Sir William and there being only one card table in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first	17.782794100389232
Their other engagements were few as the style of living of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the Collinses reach	240.40991835099712
This however was no evil to Elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were half hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors	11.583232862547103
Her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherines curiosity	8.11130830789687
Easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at Rosings which in so small a circle must be important	61.05402296585327
Elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that Mr Darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingleys designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by Lady Catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself	2.7213387683753076
His arrival was soon known at the Parsonage for Mr Collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the Park hurried home with the great intelligence	8.778013135972484
On the following morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects	4475.230401795965
There were two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them for Mr Darcy had brought with him a Colonel Fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle Lord and to the great surprise of all the party when Mr Collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him	12.91549665014884
Charlotte had seen them from her husbands room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding I may thank you Eliza for this piece of civility	20.691380811147894
Mr Darcy would never have come so soon to wait upon me Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the door bell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room	15.505157798326243
Colonel Fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman	240.40991835099712
Elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word	2065.0940845540185
Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a well bred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to Mrs Collins sat for some time without speaking to any body	11.583232862547103
At length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the health of her family	240.40991835099712
She answered him in the usual way and after a moments pause added My eldest sister has been in town these three months	121.15276586285881
Have you never happened to see her there She was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet	6.812920690579612
The subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away	3727.5937203149383
CHAPTER VIII	1.284857555844875
Colonel Fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of their engagements at Rosings	52.983169062837085
It was some days however before they received any invitation thither for while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till Easter day almost a week after the gentlemens arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening	6.40400427119728
For the last week they had seen very little of either Lady Catherine or her daughter	873.3261623828432
The invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in Lady Catherines drawing room	240.40991835099712
Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them any thing was a welcome relief to him at Rosings and Mrs Collinss pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much	41.011270705513006
He now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself as well as of Mr Darcy	6.218001087320917
eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out What is that you are saying Fitzwilliam	13.68874509537081
What is it you are talking of	976.9214157645
What are you telling Miss Bennet	627.2367209905697
Then pray speak aloud	97.91709669801119
I must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music	2154.4346900318833
And so would Anne if her health had allowed her to apply	5054.080905121878
How does Georgiana get on Darcy Mr Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sisters proficiency	873.3261623828432
I am very glad to hear such a good account of her said Lady Catherine and pray tell her from me that she cannot expect to excel if she does not practise a great deal I assure you Madam he replied that she does not need such advice	10.481131341546856
She practises very constantly So much the better	1470.0129935990064
It cannot be done too much and when I next write to her I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account	100.00000000000001
When coffee was over Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument	121.15276586285881
He drew a chair near her	627.2367209905697
Lady Catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and moving with his usual deliberation towards the piano forte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performers countenance	11.006941712522094
Elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said You mean to frighten me Mr Darcy by coming in all this state to hear me	20.691380811147894
But I will not be alarmed though your sister play so well	3439.113621543688
There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others	428.1332398719392
I am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character in a part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit	22.456979955397745
Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of cried Colonel Fitzwilliam	2154.4346900318833
I should like to know how he behaves among strangers You shall hear then but prepare yourself for something very dreadful	187.38174228603845
The first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire you must know was at a ball and at this ball what do you think he did	61.05402296585327
He danced only four dances	219.84046323854466
I am sorry to pain you but so it was	2548.1165904471486
He danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner	61.05402296585327
Well Colonel Fitzwilliam what do I play next	1760.060344050462
My fingers wait your orders Perhaps said Darcy I should have judged better had I sought an introduction but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this said Elizabeth still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam	13.68874509537081
Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers I can answer your question said Fitzwilliam without applying to him	20.691380811147894
I cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as I often see done My fingers said Elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many womens do	17.782794100389232
But then I have always supposed it to be my own fault because I would not take the trouble of practising	187.38174228603845
It is not that I do not believe fingers as capable as any other womans of superior execution Darcy smiled and said You are perfectly right	71.09709432312432
You have employed your time much better	1120.6900652727268
No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think any thing wanting	2154.4346900318833
We neither of us perform to strangers Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine who called out to know what they were talking of	100.00000000000001
Elizabeth immediately began playing again	289.3073146308603
Lady Catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to Darcy Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a London master	26.826957952797255
Anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousins praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry had she been his relation	4.3754793750741845
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeths performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste	599.4842503189408
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyships carriage was ready to take them all home	36.51741272548377
As she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be Lady Catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her half finished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise Mr Darcy and Mr Darcy only entered the room	8.778013135972484
He seemed astonished too on finding her alone and apologised for his intrusion by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to be within	61.05402296585327
They then sat down and when her enquiries after Rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence	240.40991835099712
It was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting she had seen him last in Hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November Mr Darcy	9.55855309468529
It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr Bingley to see you all after him so soon for if I recollect right he went but the day before	41.011270705513006
He and his sisters were well I hope when you left London Perfectly so I thank you She found that she was to receive no other answer and after a short pause added I think I have understood that Mr Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again I have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future	4.641588833612779
But perhaps Mr Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle I should not be surprised said Darcy if he were to give it up as soon as any eligible purchase offers Elizabeth made no answer	6.601948484081891
She was afraid of talking longer of his friend and having nothing else to say was now determined to leave the trouble of finding a subject to him	52.983169062837085
He took the hint and soon began with This seems a very comfortable house	2154.4346900318833
Lady Catherine I believe did a great deal to it when Mr Collins first came to Hunsford I believe she did and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object Mr Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife Yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had	4.142704447847673
My friend has an excellent understanding though I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr Collins as the wisest thing she ever did	83.76776400682921
She seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends An easy distance do you call it	11.006941712522094
It is nearly fifty miles And what is fifty miles of good road	3727.5937203149383
Little more than half a days journey	948.882406812011
Yes I call it a easy distance I should never have considered the distance as one of the of the match cried Elizabeth	121.15276586285881
I should never have said Mrs Collins was settled her family It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire	187.38174228603845
Any thing beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn I suppose would appear far As he spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she understood he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield and she blushed as she answered I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family	6.218001087320917
The far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances	2154.4346900318833
Where there is fortune to make the expence of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil	1333.521432163324
But that is not the case	467.1171017734788
The gentleman experienced some change of feeling he drew back his chair took a newspaper from the table and glancing over it said in a colder voice Are you pleased with Kent A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and concise and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister just returned from their walk	5.4361836201538365
Mr Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body went away	52.983169062837085
What can be the meaning of this said Charlotte as soon as he was gone	1333.521432163324
My dear Eliza he must be in love with you or he would never have called on us in this familiar way But when Elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to Charlottes wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do which was the more probable from the time of year	4.460162165376301
All field sports were over	289.3073146308603
Within doors there was Lady Catherine books and a billiard table but gentlemen cannot be always within doors and in the nearness of the Parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day	7.53690398089854
They called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt	240.40991835099712
It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite George Wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliams manners she believed he might have the best informed mind	4.294487988789274
But why Mr Darcy came so often to the Parsonage it was more difficult to understand	873.3261623828432
Mrs Collins knew not what to make of him	1967.7310042753354
Colonel Fitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend Eliza she sat herself seriously to work to find it out She watched him whenever they were at Rosings and whenever he came to Hunsford but without much success	4.548777947003777
He certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable	599.4842503189408
It was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind	71.09709432312432
She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea and Mrs Collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friends dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power	4.641588833612779
In her kind schemes for Elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam	3727.5937203149383
He was beyond comparison the pleasantest man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages Mr Darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all	16.57723885589317
CHAPTER X	1.284857555844875
It seemed like wilful ill nature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her	14.547578108480476
He never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questions about her pleasure in being at Hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of Mr and Mrs Collinss happiness and that in speaking of Rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying too	3.6458412370707323
Could he have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his thoughts	1760.060344050462
She supposed if he meant any thing he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter	316.227766016838
It distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the Parsonage	149.24955450518294
She was engaged one day as she walked in re perusing Janes last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by Mr Darcy she saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her	10.481131341546856
Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said I did not know before that you ever walked this way I have been making the tour of the Park he replied as I generally do every year and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage	9.55855309468529
Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday said she	2525.580331332133
But I am at his disposal	505.94976898274456
He arranges the business just as he pleases And if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice	46.415888336127786
I do not know any body who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr Darcy He likes to have his own way very well replied Colonel Fitzwilliam	29.552092352028872
But so we all do	264.0029742293326
It is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor	121.15276586285881
A younger son you know must be inured to self denial and dependence In my opinion the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either	52.983169062837085
Now seriously what have you ever known of self denial and dependence	4668.333001891534
But in matters of greater weight I may suffer from the want of money	2154.4346900318833
Unless the elder brother is very sickly I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds He answered her in the same style and the subject dropped	52.983169062837085
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having somebody at his disposal	19.14481976169958
I wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind	2154.4346900318833
But perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her No said Colonel Fitzwilliam that is an advantage which he must divide with me	16.57723885589317
Does your charge give you much trouble	1120.6900652727268
She directly replied You need not be frightened	1495.8675035467763
I never heard any harm of her and I dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world	149.24955450518294
She is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance Mrs Hurst and Miss Bingley	599.4842503189408
I think I have heard you say that you know them I know them a little	873.3261623828432
yes said Elizabeth drily Mr Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr Bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him Care of him Yes I really believe Darcy take care of him in those points where he most wants care	15.505157798326243
From something that he told me in our journey hither I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted to him	187.38174228603845
What he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer Did Mr Darcy give you his reasons for this interference I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady And what arts did he use to separate them He did not talk to me of his own arts said Fitzwilliam smiling	2.7213387683753076
After watching her a little Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful	3727.5937203149383
I am thinking of what you have been telling me said she	3760.0647792796403
Your cousins conduct does not suit my feelings	1760.060344050462
Why was he to be the judge You are rather disposed to call his interference officious I do not see what right Mr Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friends inclination or why upon his own judgment alone he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy But she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him	4.548777947003777
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case That is not an unnatural surmise said Fitzwilliam but it is lessening the honour of my cousins triumph very sadly This was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr Darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage	4.641588833612779
There shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard	100.00000000000001
It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected	240.40991835099712
There could not exist in the world men over whom Mr Darcy could have such boundless influence	599.4842503189408
That he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate Mr Bingley and Jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and arrangement of them	26.826957952797255
He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted	32.74549162877729
There were some very strong objections against the lady were Colonel Fitzwilliams words and these strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in London	22.456979955397745
All loveliness and goodness as she is	1031.2143746216375
Her understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating	3194.4674919357367
Neither could any thing be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities which Mr Darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach When she thought of her mother indeed her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections had material weight with Mr Darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friends connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining Mr Bingley for his sister	2.7213387683753076
Mrs Collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but Mr Collins could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherines being rather displeased by her staying at home	12.91549665014884
CHAPTER XI	1.284857555844875
When they were gone Elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against Mr Darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her being in Kent	17.782794100389232
They contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering	316.227766016838
But in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards every one had been scarcely ever clouded	10.0
Mr Darcys shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sisters sufferings	149.24955450518294
It was some consolation to think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with Jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do	8.431909292866257
She could not think of Darcys leaving Kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him	11.583232862547103
While settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the door bell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her	10.0
He sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room	1333.521432163324
Elizabeth was surprised but said not a word	1249.4119221812139
You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you Elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression	316.227766016838
She stared coloured doubted and was silent	1046.3393929311092
He spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride	46.415888336127786
His sense of her inferiority of its being a degradation of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit	12.91549665014884
In spite of her deeply rooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger	7.53690398089854
He concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand	15.505157798326243
As he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer	599.4842503189408
He of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security	4341.218347705809
But I cannot I have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly	428.1332398719392
I am sorry to have occasioned pain to any one	2415.445474887536
It has been most unconsciously done however and I hope will be of short duration	1333.521432163324
His complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature	599.4842503189408
He was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it	149.24955450518294
The pause was to Elizabeths feelings dreadful	1120.6900652727268
At length in a voice of forced calmness he said And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting	83.76776400682921
I might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little at civility I am thus rejected	599.4842503189408
But it is of small importance I might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character	12.91549665014884
Was not this some excuse for incivility if I uncivil	3393.7481503500094
But I have other provocations	258.92699382537717
You know I have	87.7319564626089
Had not my own feelings decided against you had they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister As she pronounced these words Mr Darcy changed colour but the emotion was short and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued	4.738879609717654
I have every reason in the world to think ill of you	3577.2983729342636
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity	2845.4706062300984
Can you deny that you have done it she repeated	2643.888023353627
Towards I have been kinder than towards myself Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection but its meaning did not escape nor was it likely to conciliate her	41.011270705513006
But it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded	1333.521432163324
In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself	4147.021935625597
You have reduced him to his present state of poverty comparative poverty	5125.616880269244
You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him	1333.521432163324
You have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert	187.38174228603845
This is the estimation in which you hold me	2221.9042328698197
I thank you for explaining it so fully	1459.298886060923
My faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed	2525.580331332133
But perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offences might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design	16.57723885589317
But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence	1760.060344050462
Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related	2390.6215493862082
They were natural and just	289.3073146308603
Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connections	4869.767824200445
She went on	19.280007499081826
From the very beginning from the first moment I may almost say of my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form that ground work of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry You have said quite enough madam	3.359818286283782
I perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been	428.1332398719392
The tumult of her mind was now painfully great	2004.0145275309874
She knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for half an hour	316.227766016838
Her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it	873.3261623828432
That she should receive an offer of marriage from Mr Darcy	3007.244690198459
so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own case was almost incredible	14.547578108480476
it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection	3784.3015707929035
But his pride his abominable pride his shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to Jane his unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned Mr Wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited	5.722367659350217
She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady Catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter Charlottes observation and hurried her away to her room	36.51741272548377
Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes	428.1332398719392
The park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground	187.38174228603845
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park	36.51741272548377
She was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being Mr Darcy she was directly retreating	14.547578108480476
But the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name	240.40991835099712
She had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be Mr Darcy she moved again towards the gate	71.09709432312432
He had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you	17.782794100389232
With no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity Elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand The envelope itself was likewise full Pursuing her way along the lane she then began it	8.431909292866257
It was dated from Rosings at eight oclock in the morning and was as follows Be not alarmed Madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you	11.006941712522094
You must therefore pardon the freedom with which I demand your attention your feelings I know will bestow it unwillingly but I demand it of your justice	61.05402296585327
The first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either I had detached Mr Bingley from your sister and the other that I had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr Wickham Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison But from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance I shall hope to be in future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read If in the explanation of them which is due to myself I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours I can only say that I am sorry The necessity must be obeyed and farther apology would be absurd I had not been long in Hertfordshire before I saw in common with others that Bingley preferred your eldest sister to any other young woman in the country But it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment I had often seen him in love before At that ball while I had the honour of dancing with you I was first made acquainted by Sir William Lucass accidental information that Bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage	1.4754310503547714
From that moment I observed my friends behaviour attentively and I could then perceive that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed in him	46.415888336127786
Your sister I also watched Her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and I remained convinced from the evenings scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment If have not been mistaken here must have been in an error	6.40400427119728
But I shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sisters countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched That I was desirous of believing her indifferent is certain but I will venture to say that my investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it I believed it on impartial conviction as truly as I wished it in reason My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me But there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances I had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me These causes must be stated though briefly The situation of your mothers family though objectionable was nothing in comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father Pardon me It pains me to offend you	1.6460772642611805
He had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard But Bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgment than on his own To convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point	11.006941712522094
To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment I cannot blame myself for having done thus much	46.415888336127786
There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in town	13.68874509537081
If I have wounded your sisters feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient I have not yet learnt to condemn them With respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured Mr Wickham I can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family	6.042963902381328
Mr Wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the Pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on George Wickham who was his god son his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed	7.2789538439831505
My father supported him at school and afterwards at Cambridge most important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentlemans education	24.484367468222267
My father was not only fond of this young mans society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it	17.782794100389232
As for myself it is many many years since I first began to think of him in a very different manner	187.38174228603845
The vicious propensities the want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which Mr Darcy could not have	8.778013135972484
Here again I shall give you pain to what degree you only can tell	2154.4346900318833
There was also a legacy of one thousand pounds	2004.0145275309874
His own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events Mr Wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped I should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited	7.038135554931555
He had some intention he added of studying the law and I must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein	46.415888336127786
I rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal	187.38174228603845
I knew that Mr Wickham ought not to be a clergyman	2225.850967492443
The business was therefore soon settled	627.2367209905697
He resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds	41.011270705513006
All connection between us seemed now dissolved	1120.6900652727268
I thought too ill of him to invite him to Pemberley or admit his society in town	599.4842503189408
In town I believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation	32.74549162877729
For about three years I heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation	24.484367468222267
He had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if I would present him to the living in question of which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for and I could not have forgotten my revered fathers intentions	6.601948484081891
You will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition of it	316.227766016838
His resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstances and he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself	41.011270705513006
After this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropt	2390.6215493862082
How he lived I know not	511.7046253376624
I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being	41.011270705513006
Having said thus much I feel no doubt of your secrecy	3735.5831206719067
My sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mothers nephew Colonel Fitzwilliam and myself	121.15276586285881
About a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in London and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate and thither also went Mr Wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and Mrs Younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to Georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement	2.962771191970869
I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then Georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me	16.57723885589317
You may imagine what I felt and how I acted	3228.4752973329614
Regard for my sisters credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but I wrote to Mr Wickham who left the place immediately and Mrs Younge was of course removed from her charge	32.74549162877729
Mr Wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement	36.51741272548377
His revenge would have been complete indeed	805.546626673697
This madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will I hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards Mr Wickham	19.14481976169958
I know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he has imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at	71.09709432312432
You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night	3727.5937203149383
But I was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed	428.1332398719392
For the truth of every thing here related I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel Fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my fathers will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions	10.0
If your abhorrence of should make assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him I shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning	9.152473108773892
I will only add God bless you	1046.3393929311092
If Elizabeth when Mr Darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents	41.011270705513006
But such as they were it may be well supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited	100.00000000000001
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined	3071.2511016511903
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal	19.14481976169958
With a strong prejudice against every thing he might say she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield	240.40991835099712
She read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes	22.456979955397745
His belief of her sisters insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice	22.456979955397745
He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty	316.227766016838
It was all pride and insolence	570.3383117851288
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr Wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition	6.812920690579612
She wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming This must be false	5079.894397423908
This cannot be	16.806655832511165
This must be the grossest falsehood and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again	12.216773489967919
In this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence	6.042963902381328
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late Mr Darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words	17.782794100389232
So far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great	428.1332398719392
But when she read and re read with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of Wickhams resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate	14.547578108480476
She put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success	71.09709432312432
On both sides it was only assertion	1031.2143746216375
Again she read on	97.91709669801119
But every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render Mr Darcys conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole	11.583232862547103
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to Mr Wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice	41.011270705513006
She had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire Militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance	19.14481976169958
As to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of enquiring	316.227766016838
His countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue	873.3261623828432
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr Darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance	6.812920690579612
But no such recollection befriended her	579.9085843097012
After pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read	2154.4346900318833
But alas	1.284857555844875
At one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that Mr Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousins corroboration	9.152473108773892
She perfectly remembered every thing that had passed in conversation between Wickham and herself in their first evening at Mr Philipss	187.38174228603845
Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory	3071.2511016511903
She was struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before	316.227766016838
She saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct	187.38174228603845
She remembered also that till the Netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been every where discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking Mr Darcys character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son	6.042963902381328
His attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at any thing	20.691380811147894
His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shewn	17.782794100389232
Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of Mr Darcy she could not but allow that Mr Bingley when questioned by Jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintance an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways seen any thing that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust any thing that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits	3.2769055017089728
That among his own connections he was esteemed and valued that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of amiable feeling	15.505157798326243
She grew absolutely ashamed of herself Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think without feeling that she had been blind partial prejudiced absurd	100.00000000000001
How despicably have I acted she cried I who have prided myself on my discernment I who have valued myself on my abilities	121.15276586285881
who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable distrust How humiliating is this discovery Yet how just a humiliation Had I been in love I could not have been more wretchedly blind	14.547578108480476
But vanity not love has been my folly Pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance I have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned	13.68874509537081
Widely different was the effect of a second perusal How could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious of her sisters attachment and she could not help remembering what Charlottes opinion had always been Neither could she deny the justice of his description of Jane She felt that Janes feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility	3.359818286283782
When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe	46.415888336127786
The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers	11.583232862547103
The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt	2436.724296933737
After wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thought re considering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation	4.3754793750741845
She was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each called during her absence Mr Darcy only for a few minutes to take leave but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found Elizabeth could but just concern in missing him she really rejoiced at it	5.30441727984393
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object	907.6727590114535
The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning and Mr Collins having been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisance was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings	7.038135554931555
Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her ladyships indignation would have been	14.547578108480476
But I am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me They were excessively sorry to go	83.76776400682921
Lady Catherine observed after dinner that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added But if that is the case you must write to your mother to beg that you may stay a little longer	8.11130830789687
Mrs Collins will be very glad of your company I am sure I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation replied Elizabeth but it is not in my power to accept it I must be in town next Saturday Why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks	8.11130830789687
I expected you to stay two months	976.9214157645
I told Mrs Collins so before you came	1655.8735216287728
There can be no occasion for your going so soon	2405.1823781413623
Mrs Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight But my father cannot He wrote last week to hurry my return Oh	149.24955450518294
your father of course may spare you if your mother can Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father	187.38174228603845
And if you will stay another complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London for I am going there early in June for a week and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box there will be very good room for one of you and indeed if the weather should happen to be cool I should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large You are all kindness Madam but I believe we must abide by our original plan Lady Catherine seemed resigned	3.2374575428176438
You know I always speak my mind and I cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves	187.38174228603845
I have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing Young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life	52.983169062837085
When my niece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer I made a point of her having two men servants go with her Miss Darcy the daughter of Mr Darcy of Pemberley and Lady Anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner I am excessively attentive to all those things	8.778013135972484
You must send John with the young ladies Mrs Collins	2776.425196706255
I am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be discreditable to to let them go alone My uncle is to send a servant for us Oh Your uncle He keeps a man servant does he I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things	8.431909292866257
Bromley of course If you mention my name at the Bell you will be attended to Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was	6.601948484081891
Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections	14.547578108480476
Mr Darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart	2154.4346900318833
She studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different	1333.521432163324
His attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again	29.552092352028872
In her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin	52.983169062837085
They were hopeless of remedy	289.3073146308603
Her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil	22.456979955397745
Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence what chance could there be of improvement	29.552092352028872
Catherine weak spirited irritable and completely under Lydias guidance had been always affronted by their advice and Lydia self willed and careless would scarcely give them a hearing	52.983169062837085
They were ignorant idle and vain	579.9085843097012
While there was an officer in Meryton they would flirt with him and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn they would be going there for ever	52.983169062837085
His affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend	52.983169062837085
How grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness Jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family	22.456979955397745
When to these recollections was added the developement of Wickhams character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful	13.68874509537081
When they parted Lady Catherine with great condescension wished them a good journey and invited them to come to Hunsford again next year and Miss De Bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both	15.505157798326243
CHAPTER XV	1.284857555844875
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary	32.74549162877729
I know not Miss Elizabeth said he whether Mrs Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it	17.782794100389232
The favour of your company has been much felt I assure you	4297.76244851044
We know how little there is to tempt any one to our humble abode	2154.4346900318833
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with Charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make feel the obliged	61.05402296585327
Mr Collins was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably	61.05402296585327
We have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with Rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene I think we may flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome	9.152473108773892
Our situation with regard to Lady Catherines family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast	187.38174228603845
You see on what a footing we are	1760.060344050462
In truth I must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage I should not think any one abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was obliged to walk about the room while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences	5.4361836201538365
You may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into Hertfordshire my dear cousin	873.3261623828432
I flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so	3572.1633841966855
Lady Catherines great attentions to Mrs Collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether I trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate but on this point it will be as well to be silent	15.505157798326243
We seem to have been designed for each other Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts	16.57723885589317
She was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from whom they sprung	149.24955450518294
Her home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their dependent concerns had not yet lost their charms	187.38174228603845
At length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels placed within and it was pronounced to be ready	187.38174228603845
After an affectionate parting between the friends Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr Collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter and his compliments to Mr and Mrs Gardiner though unknown	6.601948484081891
But he added you will of course wish to have your humble respects delivered to them with your grateful thanks for their kindness to you while you have been here Elizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off	11.006941712522094
Good gracious cried Maria after a few minutes silence it seems but a day or two since we first came and yet how many things have happened A great many indeed said her companion with a sigh	20.691380811147894
We have dined nine times at Rosings besides drinking tea there twice How much I shall have to tell Elizabeth privately added And how much I shall have to conceal Their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they reached Mr Gardiners house where they were to remain a few days	6.40400427119728
Jane looked well and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them	71.09709432312432
But Jane was to go home with her and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation	428.1332398719392
It was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for Longbourn before she told her sister of Mr Darcys proposals	121.15276586285881
To know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish Jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her sister farther	3.4485331776221058
After welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming Is not this nice	71.09709432312432
is not this an agreeable surprise And we mean to treat you all added Lydia but you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there Then shewing her purchases Look here I have bought this bonnet	12.91549665014884
I do not think it is very pretty but I thought I might as well buy it as not	316.227766016838
but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and when I have bought some prettier coloured satin to trim it with fresh I think it will be very tolerable	32.74549162877729
Besides it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the shire have left Meryton and they are going in a fortnight Are they indeed cried Elizabeth with the greatest satisfaction	29.552092352028872
They are going to be encamped near Brighton and I do so want papa to take us all there for the summer	149.24955450518294
It would be such a delicious scheme and I dare say would hardly cost any thing at all	428.1332398719392
Mamma would like to go too of all things	2141.953885092933
Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have Yes thought Elizabeth would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once	71.09709432312432
Good Heaven	1.284857555844875
Brighton and a whole campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia and the monthly balls of Meryton Now I have got some news for you said Lydia as they sat down to table	14.547578108480476
What do you think	58.653279816506014
Lydia laughed and said Aye that is just like your formality and discretion	3727.5937203149383
But he is an ugly fellow	527.3034436545236
I am glad he is gone	465.20020904825043
I never saw such a long chin in my life	2359.657804183458
Well but now for my news it is about dear Wickham too good for the waiter is not it	316.227766016838
Theres for you	19.280007499081826
She is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool gone to stay	4845.022090449283
Wickham is safe And Mary King is safe added Elizabeth safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune She is a great fool for going away if she liked him But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side said Jane	13.68874509537081
I am sure there is not on	618.6106316697725
I am glad I bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox	428.1332398719392
Have you seen any pleasant men	627.2367209905697
I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back	428.1332398719392
She is almost three and twenty	570.3383117851288
Lord how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty	2154.4346900318833
My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands you cant think	4913.599025871819
Lord	1.2848575558448747
how I should like to be married before any of you and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls	149.24955450518294
Dear me	1.284857555844875
we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forsters	2154.4346900318833
Kitty and me were to spend the day there and Mrs Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening by the bye Mrs Forster and me are friends and so she asked the two Harringtons to come but Harriet was ill and so Pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did	6.601948484081891
We dressed up Chamberlayne in womans clothes on purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun	428.1332398719392
Not a soul knew of it but Col	1655.8735216287728
and Mrs Forster and Kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked	52.983169062837085
When Denny and Wickham and Pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least	100.00000000000001
Lord	1.2848575558448747
how I laughed	19.280007499081826
and so did Mrs Forster	289.3073146308603
I thought I should have died	402.1459156441438
And made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did Lydia assisted by Kittys hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn	12.216773489967919
Elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickhams name	428.1332398719392
Their reception at home was most kind	1120.6900652727268
Mrs Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty and more than once during dinner did Mr Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth I am glad you are come back Lizzy Their party in the dining room was large for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news and various were the subjects which occupied them lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter Mrs Bennet was doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane who sat some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases and Lydia in a voice rather louder than any other persons was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her	2.289350193638287
Mary said she I wish you had gone with us for we had such fun	1333.521432163324
as we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and I should have gone so all the way if Kitty had not been sick and when we got to the George I do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too	4.548777947003777
And then when we came away it was such fun	2890.9074477977106
I thought we never should have got into the coach	3228.4752973329614
I was ready to die of laughter	1022.712713897267
And then we were so merry all the way home	2928.8192372667363
we talked and laughed so loud that any body might have heard us ten miles off To this Mary very gravely replied Far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures	26.826957952797255
She seldom listened to any body for more than half a minute and never attended to Mary at all	316.227766016838
In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to Meryton and see how every body went on but Elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme	46.415888336127786
It should not be said that the Miss Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers	83.76776400682921
There was another reason too for her opposition	1655.8735216287728
She dreaded seeing Wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible	1333.521432163324
In a fortnight they were to go and once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account	121.15276586285881
She had not been many hours at home before she found that the Brighton scheme of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents	29.552092352028872
Elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last	17.782794100389232
CHAPTER XVII	1.284857555844875
Miss Bennets astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings	46.415888336127786
She was sorry that Mr Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given him	20.691380811147894
His being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment Indeed replied Elizabeth I am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me	9.55855309468529
You do not blame me however for refusing him Blame you	3901.6510155620135
What a stroke was this for poor Jane	1760.060344050462
Nor was Darcys vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery	873.3261623828432
Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear one without involving the other	240.40991835099712
This will not do said Elizabeth	547.2418975491341
Take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one	3107.8866065640455
There is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much	46.415888336127786
For my part I am inclined to believe it all Mr Darcys but you shall do as you chuse It was some time however before a smile could be extorted from Jane	32.74549162877729
Wickham so very bad	97.91709669801119
It is almost past belief	289.3073146308603
And poor Mr Darcy	97.91709669801119
dear Lizzy only consider what he must have suffered	2221.9042328698197
Such a disappointment	19.280007499081826
and having to relate such a thing of his sister	2805.8826660581653
It is really too distressing	240.91188461952237
I am sure you must feel it so Oh	1405.2464966369218
I know you will do him such ample justice that I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent	316.227766016838
such an openness and gentleness in his manner There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men	149.24955450518294
One has got all the goodness and the other all the appearance of it I never thought Mr Darcy so deficient in the of it as you used to do And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason	10.0
I was very uncomfortable I may say unhappy	1537.8209446592753
And with no one to speak to of what I felt no Jane to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as I knew I had	24.484367468222267
how I wanted you How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr Darcy for now they appear wholly undeserved Certainly	46.415888336127786
But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging	316.227766016838
There is one point on which I want your advice	3038.8994495021866
I want to be told whether I ought or ought not to make our acquaintance in general understand Wickhams character Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully	17.782794100389232
What is your own opinion That it ought not to be attempted	3972.690029577154
On the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me	19.14481976169958
The general prejudice against Mr Darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light	36.51741272548377
I am not equal to it	381.59882406471877
Wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anybody here what he really is	428.1332398719392
Sometime hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before	187.38174228603845
At present I will say nothing about it You are quite right	4019.084472487529
To have his errors made public might ruin him for ever	4341.218347705809
He is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to re establish a character	599.4842503189408
We must not make him desperate The tumult of Elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation	873.3261623828432
She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in Jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either	24.484367468222267
But there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbad the disclosure	3727.5937203149383
She dared not relate the other half of Mr Darcys letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by his friend	83.76776400682921
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery	26.826957952797255
And then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place I shall merely be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself	36.51741272548377
Jane was not happy	87.7319564626089
She still cherished a very tender affection for Bingley	2525.580331332133
Having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than first attachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity	4.071515547789689
Well Lizzy said Mrs Bennet one day what is your opinion of this sad business of Janes	599.4842503189408
I told my sister Philips so the other day	2133.6157589848535
But I cannot find out that Jane saw any thing of him in London	2154.4346900318833
There is no talk of his coming to Netherfield again in the summer and I have enquired of every body too who is likely to know I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more Oh well	15.505157798326243
it is just as he chooses	527.3034436545236
Nobody wants him to come	240.91188461952237
Though I shall always say that he used my daughter extremely ill and if I was her I would not have put up with it	83.76776400682921
Well my comfort is I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer	16.57723885589317
Well Lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the Collinses live very comfortable do they	873.3261623828432
Well well I only hope it will last	1526.5461786045162
Charlotte is an excellent manager I dare say	1292.4062289430328
Yes yes	1.284857555844875
will take care not to outrun their income	1634.5799516636096
will never be distressed for money	570.3383117851288
Well much good may it do them	1120.6900652727268
And so I suppose they often talk of having Longbourn when your father is dead	1333.521432163324
It would have been strange if they had	1123.6391794831272
But I make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves	4710.351154021535
Well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better	316.227766016838
should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me CHAPTER XVIII	2154.4346900318833
The first week of their return was soon gone	2525.580331332133
The second began	19.280007499081826
The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments	187.38174228603845
Very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such hard heartedness in any of the family	41.011270705513006
Good Heaven	1.284857555844875
How can you be smiling so Lizzy Their affectionate mother shared all their grief she remembered what she had herself endured on a similar occasion five and twenty years ago	41.011270705513006
I am sure said she I cried for two days together when Colonel Millars regiment went away	599.4842503189408
If one could but go to Brighton observed Mrs Bennet	2634.686724699701
Oh yes if one could but go to Brighton	1911.6813221341906
But papa is so disagreeable A little sea bathing would set me up for ever And my aunt Philips is sure it would do a great deal of good added Kitty	36.51741272548377
Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame	873.3261623828432
She felt anew the justice of Mr Darcys objections and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend	52.983169062837085
But the gloom of Lydias prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from Mrs Forster the wife of the Colonel of the regiment to accompany her to Brighton	36.51741272548377
This invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married	4552.481093773604
The rapture of Lydia on this occasion her adoration of Mrs Forster the delight of Mrs Bennet and the mortification of Kitty are scarcely to be described	61.05402296585327
Wholly inattentive to her sisters feelings Lydia flew about the house in restless ecstacy calling for every ones congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish	10.0
I cannot see why Mrs Forster should not ask as well as Lydia said she though I am her particular friend	187.38174228603845
I have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for I am two years older In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and Jane to make her resigned	22.456979955397745
As for Elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go	5.878016072274914
She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydias general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as Mrs Forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at Brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home	9.152473108773892
He heard her attentively and then said Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances If you were aware said Elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of Lydias unguarded and imprudent manner nay which has already arisen from it I am sure you would judge differently in the affair Already arisen repeated Mr Bennet	3.317671127842857
What has she frightened away some of your lovers	2525.580331332133
Come let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydias folly Indeed you are mistaken	149.24955450518294
I have no such injuries to resent	891.4838872153653
It is not of peculiar but of general evils which I am now complaining	2154.4346900318833
Excuse me for I must speak plainly	1046.3393929311092
A flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite	11.006941712522094
In this danger Kitty is also comprehended	1120.6900652727268
She will follow wherever Lydia leads	627.2367209905697
Oh	1.2848575558448747
my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace Mr Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject and affectionately taking her hand said in reply Do not make yourself uneasy my love	7.038135554931555
We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to Brighton	2154.4346900318833
Let her go then	97.91709669801119
Colonel Forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to any body	41.011270705513006
At Brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here	428.1332398719392
Let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance	2154.4346900318833
At any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry	12.216773489967919
It was not in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them	1333.521432163324
She was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition	83.76776400682921
In Lydias imagination a visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness	3727.5937203149383
She saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathing place covered with officers	428.1332398719392
She saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown	599.4842503189408
Lydias going to Brighton was all that consoled her for the melancholy conviction of her husbands never intending to go there himself	149.24955450518294
Elizabeth was now to see Mr Wickham for the last time	3401.124496463046
Having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so	149.24955450518294
She had even learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary	100.00000000000001
In his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her	12.91549665014884
She lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal	6.042963902381328
On the very last day of the regiments remaining in Meryton he dined with others of the officers at Longbourn and so little was Elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford she mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliams and Mr Darcys having both spent three weeks at Rosings and asked him if he were acquainted with the former	4.548777947003777
He looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moments recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very gentleman like man asked her how she had liked him	16.57723885589317
Her answer was warmly in his favour	994.5804157604407
With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added How long did you say that he was at Rosings Nearly three weeks And you saw him frequently Yes almost every day His manners are very different from his cousins Yes very different	14.547578108480476
But I think Mr Darcy improves on acquaintance Indeed cried Wickham with a look which did not escape her	316.227766016838
Has he deigned to add ought of civility to his ordinary style	5125.616880269244
In essentials I believe he is very much what he ever was While she spoke Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning	32.74549162877729
His pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must deter him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by	41.011270705513006
I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you I imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgment he stands much in awe	22.456979955397745
His fear of her has always operated I know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with Miss De Bourgh which I am certain he has very much at heart Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head	6.40400427119728
She saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him	100.00000000000001
The rest of the evening passed with the on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no farther attempt to distinguish Elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again	17.782794100389232
When the party broke up Lydia returned with Mrs Forster to Meryton from whence they were to set out early the next morning	121.15276586285881
Mrs Bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she would not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possible advice which there was every reason to believe would be attended to and in the clamorous happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard	5.30441727984393
CHAPTER XIX	1.284857555844875
Had Elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing picture of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort	83.76776400682921
Her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her	12.91549665014884
Respect esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown	599.4842503189408
But Mr Bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice	19.14481976169958
To his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement	240.40991835099712
This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given	19.14481976169958
She had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible	7.038135554931555
But she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so ill judged a direction of talents talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife	6.042963902381328
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickhams departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment	240.40991835099712
Their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dulness of every thing around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp	3.4485331776221058
Upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself	20.691380811147894
It was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity to have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment	11.006941712522094
Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable and could she have included Jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect	9.55855309468529
Were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain	3393.7481503500094
But here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sisters absence I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realized	61.05402296585327
A scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty but her letters were always long expected and always very short	7.53690398089854
Those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as Mrs Forster called her and they were going to the camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learnt for her letters to Kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public	2.7953009456081994
After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerfulness began to re appear at Longbourn	187.38174228603845
The families who had been in town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose	240.40991835099712
Mrs Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office another regiment should be quartered in Meryton	4.216965034285823
The time fixed for the beginning of their Northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from Mrs Gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent	17.782794100389232
Mr Gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in July and must be in London again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the Lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire	3.5436477855785484
The town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock Chatsworth Dovedale or the Peak	13.68874509537081
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes and still thought there might have been time enough	149.24955450518294
With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected	3020.6580511248785
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner	873.3261623828432
But surely said she I may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me The period of expectation was now doubled	41.011270705513006
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunts arrival	4425.06972684674
But they did pass away and Mr and Mrs Gardiner with their four children did at length appear at Longbourn	240.40991835099712
The children two girls of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin Jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every way teaching them playing with them and loving them	7.2789538439831505
The Gardiners staid only one night at Longbourn and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement	149.24955450518294
One enjoyment was certain that of suitableness as companions a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniences cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure and affection and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad	17.782794100389232
are sufficiently known	19.280007499081826
A small part of Derbyshire is all the present concern	3071.2511016511903
It was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it	599.4842503189408
In talking over their route the evening before Mrs Gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again	428.1332398719392
My love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much said her aunt	240.40991835099712
A place too with which so many of your acquaintance are connected	4869.767824200445
Wickham passed all his youth there you know Elizabeth was distressed	4341.218347705809
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it	316.227766016838
Mrs Gardiner abused her stupidity	289.3073146308603
They have some of the finest woods in the country Elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce	240.40991835099712
The possibility of meeting Mr Darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred	5079.894397423908
It would be dreadful	85.71168360275243
She blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk	100.00000000000001
But against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries as to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered	36.51741272548377
Accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer	19.14481976169958
A most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms being now removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme	5.722367659350217
To Pemberley therefore they were to go	801.6551108737276

Illustration DOVE DALE PRIDE PREJUDICE	289.3073146308603
Elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter	29.552092352028872
The park was very large and contained great variety of ground	4341.218347705809
They gradually ascended for half a mile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by Pemberley House situated on the opposite side of a valley into which the road with some abruptness wound	11.006941712522094
It was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high woody hills and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance	17.782794100389232
Its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned	1760.060344050462
Elizabeth was delighted	19.280007499081826
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste	83.76776400682921
They were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something	100.00000000000001
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken	1655.8735216287728
On applying to see the place they were admitted into the hall and Elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was	41.011270705513006
The housekeeper came a respectable looking elderly woman much less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her	149.24955450518294
They followed her into the dining parlour	835.1634361778631
It was a large well proportioned room handsomely fitted up	2726.2346532389297
Every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight	20.691380811147894
As they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions but from every window there were beauties to be seen	149.24955450518294
And of this place thought she I might have been mistress	3483.203598222439
With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted	3228.4752973329614
Instead of viewing them as a stranger I might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt But no recollecting herself that could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me I should not have been allowed to invite them This was a lucky recollection it saved her from something like regret	5.722367659350217
She longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really absent but had not courage for it	316.227766016838
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture	3175.2922756799617
She approached and saw the likeness of Mr Wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantle piece	428.1332398719392
Her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it	2525.580331332133
The housekeeper came forward and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman the son of her late masters steward who had been brought up by him at his own expence He is now gone into the army she added but I am afraid he has turned out very wild Mrs Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but Elizabeth could not return it	5.4361836201538365
And that said Mrs Reynolds pointing to another of the miniatures is my master and very like him	428.1332398719392
It was drawn at the same time as the other about eight years ago I have heard much of your masters fine person said Mrs Gardiner looking at the picture it is a handsome face	24.484367468222267
Does that young lady know Mr Darcy Elizabeth coloured and said A little And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman Maam Yes very handsome I am sure know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this	9.152473108773892
This room was my late masters favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then	316.227766016838
He was very fond of them This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr Wickhams being among them	873.3261623828432
Mrs Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy drawn when she was only eight years old	316.227766016838
And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother said Mr Gardiner	4869.767824200445
Oh	1.2848575558448747
yes the handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplished She plays and sings all day long	316.227766016838
In the next room is a new instrument just come down for her a present from my master she comes here to morrow with him Mr Gardiner whose manners were easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks Mrs Reynolds either from pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister	6.601948484081891
Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year Not so much as I could wish Sir but I dare say he may spend half his time here and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months Except thought Elizabeth when she goes to Ramsgate If your master would marry you might see more of him Yes Sir but I do not know when will be	5.0608719869196825
I do not know who is good enough for him Mr and Mrs Gardiner smiled	1333.521432163324
Elizabeth could not help saying It is very much to his credit I am sure that you should think so I say no more than the truth and what every body will say that knows him replied the other	17.782794100389232
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added I have never had a cross word from him in my life and I have known him ever since he was four years old This was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas	8.11130830789687
Her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying There are very few people of whom so much can be said	41.011270705513006
You are lucky in having such a master Yes Sir I know I am	2154.4346900318833
If I was to go through the world I could not meet with a better	1333.521432163324
But I have always observed that they who are good natured when children are good natured when they grow up and he was always the sweetest tempered most generous hearted boy in the world Elizabeth almost stared at her Can this be Mr Darcy thought she	11.583232862547103
His father was an excellent man said Mrs Gardiner	2347.3383439049167
Yes Maam that he was indeed and his son will be just like him just as affable to the poor Elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more	46.415888336127786
Mrs Reynolds could interest her on no other point	2525.580331332133
She related the subject of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain	240.40991835099712
Mr Gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase	13.68874509537081
He is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever lived	2154.4346900318833
There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will give him a good name	599.4842503189408
Some people call him proud but I am sure I never saw any thing of it	873.3261623828432
To my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men In what an amiable light does this place him thought Elizabeth	61.05402296585327
This fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend Perhaps we might be deceived That is not very likely our authority was too good On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shewn into a very pretty sitting room lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at Pemberley	3.495250132675474
He is certainly a good brother said Elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows	873.3261623828432
And this is always the way with him she added Whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment	83.76776400682921
There is nothing he would not do for her The picture gallery and two or three of the principal bed rooms were all that remained to be shewn	52.983169062837085
Elizabeth walked on in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her	873.3261623828432
At last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr Darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her	29.552092352028872
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery	240.40991835099712
Mrs Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers life time	2154.4346900318833
There was certainly at this moment in Elizabeths mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of their acquaintance	61.05402296585327
The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs Reynolds was of no trifling nature	3727.5937203149383
What praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant	5346.783134922081
Every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression	6.601948484081891
When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned down stairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the hall door	20.691380811147894
As they walked across the lawn towards the river Elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables	8.778013135972484
They were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight	149.24955450518294
Their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest blush	1333.521432163324
He absolutely started and for a moment seemed immoveable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to Elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility	24.484367468222267
Amazed at the alteration in his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued together were some of the most uncomfortable of her life	8.778013135972484
Nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn and of her stay in Derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts	7.813707376518094
At length every idea seemed to fail him and after standing a few moments without saying a word he suddenly recollected himself and took leave	83.76776400682921
The others then joined her and expressed their admiration of his figure but Elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence	46.415888336127786
Her coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill judged thing in the world	1333.521432163324
How strange must it appear to him	1120.6900652727268
In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man	3727.5937203149383
It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again	2154.4346900318833
Oh	1.2848575558448747
why did she come	97.91709669801119
or why did he thus come a day before he was expected	4710.351154021535
Had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrived that moment alighted from his horse or his carriage	22.456979955397745
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting	3408.849360053744
That he should even speak to her was amazing but to speak with such civility to enquire after her family	240.40991835099712
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting	100.00000000000001
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park when he put his letter into her hand	187.38174228603845
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House whichever it might be where Mr Darcy then was	187.38174228603845
She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of every thing she was still dear to him	29.552092352028872
Perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been in his voice which was not like ease	100.00000000000001
At length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind roused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself	83.76776400682921
They entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds whence in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream	7.038135554931555
Mr Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole Park but feared it might be beyond a walk	316.227766016838
With a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round	3727.5937203149383
It settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water in one of its narrowest parts	24.484367468222267
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house Mrs Gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible	12.91549665014884
Whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and Elizabeths astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of Mr Darcy approaching them and at no great distance	20.691380811147894
Elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them	46.415888336127786
For a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path	873.3261623828432
This idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them	149.24955450518294
With a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed	6.601948484081891
Her colour changed and she said no more	1489.1627601779014
Mrs Gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends	61.05402296585327
This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself	13.68874509537081
What will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are	3727.5937203149383
He takes them now for people of fashion The introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions	8.431909292866257
Elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph	2028.349208227291
It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush	316.227766016838
The conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard Mr Darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport	7.53690398089854
Elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself	1333.521432163324
Her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating Why is he so altered	1333.521432163324
My reproofs at Hunsford could not work such a change as this	5346.783134922081
It originated in Mrs Gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found Elizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husbands	83.76776400682921
Mr Darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together	3727.5937203149383
After a short silence the lady first spoke	1526.5461786045162
She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpected for your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till to morrow and indeed before we left Bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country He acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling	3.1622776601683795
They will join me early to morrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with you Mr Bingley and his sisters Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow	29.552092352028872
Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr Bingleys name had been last mentioned between them and if she might judge from his complexion mind was not very differently engaged	29.552092352028872
She immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her	11.583232862547103
Elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased	3727.5937203149383
They soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage Mr and Mrs Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind	100.00000000000001
He then asked her to walk into the house but she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn	149.24955450518294
At such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward	2154.4346900318833
She wanted to talk but there seemed an embargo on every subject	4869.767824200446
At last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance	240.40991835099712
Yet time and her aunt moved slowly and her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the tête à tête was over	100.00000000000001
Mr Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house	187.38174228603845
He is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle	3961.512542590339
There something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming	100.00000000000001
I can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud have seen nothing of it I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us	36.51741272548377
It was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention	599.4842503189408
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling To be sure Lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as Wickham or rather he has not Wickhams countenance for his features are perfectly good	26.826957952797255
But how came you to tell us that he was so disagreeable Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning	11.583232862547103
But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle	2154.4346900318833
Your great men often are and therefore I shall not take him at his word about fishing as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character but said nothing	13.68874509537081
From what we have seen of him continued Mrs Gardiner I really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by any body as he has done by poor Wickham	22.456979955397745
He has not an ill natured look	1046.3393929311092
On the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks	3727.5937203149383
And there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart	240.40991835099712
I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes	898.9241878992768
But he is a liberal master I suppose and in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor Wickhams so amiable as they had been considered in Hertfordshire	3.5938136638046276
In confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on	24.484367468222267
Mrs Gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of any thing else	8.778013135972484
Fatigued as she had been by the mornings walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance	15.505157798326243
CHAPTER II	1.284857555844875
But her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their own arrival at Lambton these visitors came	316.227766016838
Elizabeth immediately recognising the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected	52.983169062837085
Nothing had ever suggested it before but they now felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece	29.552092352028872
While these newly born notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of Elizabeths feelings was every moment increasing	316.227766016838
She was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her	10.481131341546856
She retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made every thing worse	19.14481976169958
Miss Darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place	4869.767824200445
With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself	599.4842503189408
She found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable	2154.4346900318833
Miss Darcy was tall and on a larger scale than Elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful	61.05402296585327
She was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle	83.76776400682921
Elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr Darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings	52.983169062837085
All Elizabeths anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again	22.456979955397745
He enquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same good humoured ease that he had ever done	71.09709432312432
To Mr and Mrs Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself	1333.521432163324
The suspicions which had just arisen of Mr Darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded enquiry and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love	12.216773489967919
Of the ladys sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough	187.38174228603845
Elizabeth on her side had much to do	1526.5461786045162
She wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour	7.813707376518094
In seeing Bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh	3843.8647982081843
how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner	599.4842503189408
Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance	26.826957952797255
But though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to Miss Darcy who had been set up as a rival of Jane	52.983169062837085
Nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister	4898.878950229736
There was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning	100.00000000000001
It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr Darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so far removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day	4.738879609717654
Never even in the company of his dear friends at Netherfield or his dignified relations at Rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from self consequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings	4.641588833612779
Their visitors staid with them above half an hour and when they arose to depart Mr Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing Mr and Mrs Gardiner and Miss Bennet to dinner at Pemberley before they left the country	11.583232862547103
Miss Darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed	428.1332398719392
Presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on	10.0
Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends	41.011270705513006
Elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last half hour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little	8.11130830789687
Eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she staid with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of Bingley and then hurried away to dress	24.484367468222267
But she had no reason to fear Mr and Mrs Gardiners curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication	187.38174228603845
It was evident that she was much better acquainted with Mr Darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her	36.51741272548377
They saw much to interest but nothing to justify enquiry	3071.2511016511903
Of Mr Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find	71.09709432312432
They could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servants report without any reference to any other account the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognised it for Mr Darcy	11.583232862547103
There was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected	13.68874509537081
Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight	428.1332398719392
They had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town where the family did not visit	24.484367468222267
With respect to Wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a well known fact that on his quitting Derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which Mr Darcy afterwards discharged	7.2789538439831505
As for Elizabeth her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out	10.481131341546856
She certainly did not hate him	627.2367209905697
No hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called	71.09709432312432
The respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced	6.812920690579612
But above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of good will which could not be overlooked	187.38174228603845
It was gratitude Gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection	17.782794100389232
She respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on the renewal of his addresses	5.575305334261898
It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and niece that such a striking civility as Miss Darcys in coming to them on the very day of her arrival at Pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following morning	4.294487988789274
They were therefore to go Elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply	121.15276586285881
Mr Gardiner left them soon after breakfast	954.8622169161257
The fishing scheme had been renewed the day before and a positive engagement made of his meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley by noon	83.76776400682921
CHAPTER III	1.284857555844875
Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingleys dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how very unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be renewed	9.55855309468529
On reaching the house they were shewn through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer	187.38174228603845
Its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn	26.826957952797255
Georgianas reception of them was very civil but attended with all that embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved	15.505157798326243
Mrs Gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her	4968.068478293794
Miss Darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard	41.011270705513006
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to Miss Darcy without calling her attention	52.983169062837085
This observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much	22.456979955397745
Her own thoughts were employing her	627.2367209905697
She expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room	3727.5937203149383
She wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine	71.09709432312432
After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingleys voice Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family	36.51741272548377
She answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more	3727.5937203149383
The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from Mrs Annesley to Miss Darcy had been given to remind her of her post	7.2789538439831505
There was now employment for the whole party for though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table	26.826957952797255
While thus engaged Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr Darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came	8.431909292866257
He had been some time with Mr Gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to Georgiana that morning	13.68874509537081
In no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingleys in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to Mr Darcy were by no means over	10.0
Miss Darcy on her brothers entrance exerted herself much more to talk and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side	16.57723885589317
Miss Bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility Pray Miss Eliza are not the shire militia removed from Meryton	32.74549162877729
They must be a great loss to family In Darcys presence she dared not mention Wickhams name but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone	6.601948484081891
While she spoke an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes	41.011270705513006
Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcys meditated elopement	4913.599025871819
To no creature had it been revealed where secresy was possible except to Elizabeth and from all Bingleys connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from that very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own	12.216773489967919
He had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss Bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend	16.57723885589317
Elizabeths collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as Miss Bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to Wickham Georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more	22.456979955397745
Her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully	16.57723885589317
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while Mr Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeths person behaviour and dress	20.691380811147894
But Georgiana would not join her	627.2367209905697
Her brothers recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgment could not err and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable	19.14481976169958
How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning Mr Darcy she cried I never in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter	46.415888336127786
She is grown so brown and coarse	1120.6900652727268
Louisa and I were agreeing that we should not have known her again However little Mr Darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer	10.481131341546856
For my own part she rejoined I must confess that I never could see any beauty in her	428.1332398719392
Her nose wants character there is nothing marked in its lines	4106.961080865378
They have a sharp shrewish look which I do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a self sufficiency without fashion which is intolerable Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected	5.179474679231211
He was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued I remember when we first knew her in Hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and I particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at Netherfield a beauty I should as soon call her mother a wit	6.042963902381328
But afterwards she seemed to improve on you and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time Yes replied Darcy who could contain himself no longer but was only when I first knew her for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance He then went away and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself	4.003221666659723
Mrs Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both	121.15276586285881
The looks and behaviour of every body they had seen were discussed except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention	149.24955450518294
They talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of every thing but himself yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs Gardiner thought of him and Mrs Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces beginning the subject	14.547578108480476
CHAPTER IV	1.284857555844875
Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere	4.948168092155143
Elizabeth was not surprised at it as Jane had written the direction remarkably ill	2154.4346900318833
The one missent must be first attended to it had been written five days ago	1333.521432163324
The beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence	19.14481976169958
It was to this effect Since writing the above dearest Lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature but I am afraid of alarming you be assured that we are all well	24.484367468222267
What I have to say relates to poor Lydia	2210.7655309685183
I am very very sorry	219.81648382222872
So imprudent a match on both sides But I am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood	149.24955450518294
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart	149.24955450518294
Our poor mother is sadly grieved	579.9085843097012
My father bears it better	289.3073146308603
How thankful am I that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves	187.38174228603845
They were off Saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight	316.227766016838
The express was sent off directly	536.151591419881
My dear Lizzy they must have passed within ten miles of us	5054.080905121878
Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him here soon	3228.4752973329614
Lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention	3727.5937203149383
I must conclude for I cannot be long from my poor mother	4869.767824200445
I am afraid you will not be able to make it out but I hardly know what I have written Without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt Elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first	5.878016072274914
Dearest Lizzy I hardly know what I would write but I have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed	187.38174228603845
Imprudent as a marriage between Mr Wickham and our poor Lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland	17.782794100389232
Colonel Forster came yesterday having left Brighton the day before not many hours after the express	873.3261623828432
Though Lydias short letter to Mrs F	1046.3393929311092
never intended to go there or to marry Lydia at all which was repeated to Colonel F	599.4842503189408
who instantly taking the alarm set off from B	2525.580331332133
intending to trace their route	289.3073146308603
All that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the London road	873.3261623828432
I know not what to think	365.6456649591761
After making every possible enquiry on that side London Colonel F	4341.218347705809
With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart	121.15276586285881
I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs F	2117.1480177343865
but no one can throw any blame on them	2196.172464288084
Our distress my dear Lizzy is very great	1582.860215946767
My father and mother believe the worst but I cannot think so ill of him	1333.521432163324
Many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if could form such a design against a young woman of Lydias connections which is not likely can I suppose her so lost to every thing Impossible	9.55855309468529
I grieve to find however that Colonel F	1760.060344050462
is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his head when I expressed my hopes and said he feared W	149.24955450518294
was not a man to be trusted	768.5217696285101
My poor mother is really ill and keeps her room	3228.475297332962
Could she exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected and as to my father I never in my life saw him so affected	46.415888336127786
Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder	240.40991835099712
I am truly glad dearest Lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over shall I own that I long for your return	29.552092352028872
I am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient	3727.5937203149383
Adieu	1.2848575558448747
I take up my pen again to do what I have just told you I would not but circumstances are such that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible	22.456979955397745
I know my dear uncle and aunt so well that I am not afraid of requesting it though I have still something more to ask of the former	52.983169062837085
My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly to try to discover her	1333.521432163324
What he means to do I am sure I know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to morrow evening	14.547578108480476
In such an exigence my uncles advice and assistance would be every thing in the world he will immediately comprehend what I must feel and I rely upon his goodness Oh	36.51741272548377
Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start and before he could recover himself enough to speak she in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydias situation hastily exclaimed I beg your pardon but I must leave you	16.57723885589317
I must find Mr Gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed I have not an instant to lose Good God	149.24955450518294
what is the matter cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself I will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after Mr and Mrs Gardiner	26.826957952797255
You are not well enough you cannot go yourself Elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them	36.51741272548377
On his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration Let me call your maid	13.68874509537081
Is there nothing you could take to give you present relief A glass of wine shall I get you one You are very ill No I thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself	26.826957952797255
There is nothing the matter with me	866.9898466708397
I am only distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn She burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word	26.826957952797255
Darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence	428.1332398719392
At length she spoke again	289.3073146308603
I have just had a letter from Jane with such dreadful news	4034.449021227187
It cannot be concealed from any one	962.7998464150356
My youngest sister has left all her friends has eloped has thrown herself into the power of of Mr Wickham	240.40991835099712
They are gone off together from Brighton	1046.3393929311092
know him too well to doubt the rest	1537.8209446592753
She has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him to she is lost for ever Darcy was fixed in astonishment	149.24955450518294
When I consider she added in a yet more agitated voice that might have prevented it who knew what he was	187.38174228603845
Had I but explained some part of it only some part of what I learnt to my own family	316.227766016838
Had his character been known this could not have happened	2456.279023980724
But it is all all too late now I am grieved indeed cried Darcy grieved shocked	873.3261623828432
But is it certain absolutely certain Oh yes They left Brighton together on Sunday night and were traced almost to London but not beyond they are certainly not gone to Scotland And what has been done what has been attempted to recover her My father is gone to London and Jane has written to beg my uncles immediate assistance and we shall be off I hope in half an hour	5.0608719869196825
But nothing can be done I know very well that nothing can be done	2154.4346900318833
How are they even to be discovered	1046.3393929311092
I have not the smallest hope	313.01576958981997
It is every way horrible Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence	5054.080905121878
When eyes were opened to his real character Oh	2103.1729119339934
had I known what I ought what I dared to do	4341.218347705809
He seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air gloomy	121.15276586285881
Her power was sinking every thing sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace	187.38174228603845
It was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must be vain	24.484367468222267
But self though it would intrude could not engross her	3393.7481503500094
Lydia the humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern	3.359818286283782
Would to heaven that any thing could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress But I will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks	16.57723885589317
This unfortunate affair will I fear prevent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to day Oh yes	187.38174228603845
Say that urgent business calls us home immediately	1760.060344050462
Conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible I know it cannot be long He readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away	7.038135554931555
As he quitted the room Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination	4.738879609717654
If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection Elizabeths change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty	316.227766016838
But if otherwise if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for Wickham and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment	4.003221666659723
Be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what Lydias infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business	32.74549162877729
Never since reading Janes second letter had she entertained a hope of Wickhams meaning to marry her	599.4842503189408
No one but Jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation	3727.5937203149383
Surprise was the least of her feelings on this developement	2588.635532889554
But now it was all too natural	954.8622169161257
For such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey	9.152473108773892
She had never perceived while the regiment was in Hertfordshire that Lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that Lydia had wanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body	29.552092352028872
The mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girl Oh	5346.783134922081
how acutely did she now feel it	1120.6900652727268
She was wild to be at home to hear to see to be upon the spot to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia her uncles interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience was severe	4.216965034285823
Mr and Mrs Gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servants account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy Though Lydia had never been a favourite with them Mr and Mrs Gardiner could not but be deeply affected	4.948168092155143
Not Lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror Mr Gardiner readily promised every assistance in his power Elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit every thing relating to their journey was speedily settled	7.813707376518094
They were to be off as soon as possible	1434.6026021010157
But what is to be done about Pemberley cried Mrs Gardiner	2820.383669972735
And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real truth	2154.4346900318833
Oh that I knew how it was But wishes were vain or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour	46.415888336127786
Had Elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends in Lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure	6.812920690579612
An hour however saw the whole completed and Mr Gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and Elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to Longbourn	7.038135554931555
CHAPTER V	1.284857555844875
I have been thinking it over again Elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration I am much more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the matter	16.57723885589317
It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonels family that I am strongly inclined to hope the best	12.216773489967919
Could he expect that her friends would not step forward	3228.475297332962
Could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to Colonel Forster	599.4842503189408
His temptation is not adequate to the risk Do you really think so cried Elizabeth brightening up for a moment	240.40991835099712
Upon my word said Mrs Gardiner I begin to be of your uncles opinion	2154.4346900318833
It is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of it	316.227766016838
I cannot think so very ill of Wickham	1264.1062798194343
Can you yourself Lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest	121.15276586285881
But of every other neglect I can believe him capable	3194.4674919357367
If indeed it should be so	465.17417696326356
But I dare not hope it	527.3034436545236
Why should they not go on to Scotland if that had been the case In the first place replied Mr Gardiner there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland Oh	26.826957952797255
but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a presumption	2154.4346900318833
And besides no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road Well then supposing them to be in London	149.24955450518294
They may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptionable purpose	1333.521432163324
Why any fear of detection	264.0029742293326
Oh	1.2848575558448747
Wickham will never marry a woman without some money	2525.580331332133
He cannot afford it	97.91709669801119
As to what restraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her I am not able to judge for I know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce	19.14481976169958
But as to your other objection I am afraid it will hardly hold good	2154.4346900318833
Lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my fathers behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage It does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied Elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt	2.652948464431896
But really I know not what to say	1194.545152574567
But she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last half year nay for a twelvemonth she has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity	22.456979955397745
She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way	71.09709432312432
She has been doing every thing in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greater what shall I call it	100.00000000000001
susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough	2362.9358734847483
And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman But you see that Jane said her aunt does not think so ill of Wickham as to believe him capable of the attempt Of whom does Jane ever think ill	10.481131341546856
But Jane knows as well as I do what Wickham really is	3660.867730801381
We both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word	2154.4346900318833
That he has neither integrity nor honour	1120.6900652727268
I do indeed replied Elizabeth colouring	536.151591419881
I told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to Mr Darcy and you yourself when last at Longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him	17.782794100389232
And there are other circumstances which I am not at liberty which it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless	46.415888336127786
From what he said of Miss Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl	428.1332398719392
Yet he knew to the contrary himself	1120.6900652727268
He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her But does Lydia know nothing of this	149.24955450518294
Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand Oh yes that that is the worst of all	121.15276586285881
Till I was in Kent and saw so much both of Mr Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam I was ignorant of the truth myself	83.76776400682921
And when I returned home the shire was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnights time	599.4842503189408
As that was the case neither Jane to whom I related the whole nor I thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown	10.0
And even when it was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs Forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me	71.09709432312432
That could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head	3727.5937203149383
That such a consequence as should ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts When they all removed to Brighton therefore you had no reason I suppose to believe them fond of each other Not the slightest	16.57723885589317
I can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had any thing of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away	22.456979955397745
When first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were	428.1332398719392
From Elizabeths thoughts it was never absent	1046.3393929311092
Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish self reproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness	316.227766016838
They travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day	187.38174228603845
The little Gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome	6.218001087320917
Elizabeth jumped out and after giving each of them an hasty kiss hurried into the vestibule where Jane who came running down stairs from her mothers apartment immediately met her	41.011270705513006
Elizabeth as she affectionately embraced her whilst tears filled the eyes of both lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives	52.983169062837085
Not yet replied Jane	97.91709669801119
But now that my dear uncle is come I hope every thing will be well Is my father in town Yes he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word And have you heard from him often We have heard only once	14.547578108480476
He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which I particularly begged him to do	46.415888336127786
How are you all My mother is tolerably well I trust though her spirits are greatly shaken	599.4842503189408
She is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all	3727.5937203149383
She does not yet leave her dressing room	1634.5799516636096
are quite well But you How are you cried Elizabeth	3228.4752973329614
You look pale	19.280007499081826
How much you must have gone through Her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while Mr and Mrs Gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party	11.006941712522094
Jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears	428.1332398719392
When they were all in the drawing room the questions which Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to give	29.552092352028872
The sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from Lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce the marriage	9.55855309468529
Mrs Bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villanous conduct of Wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing	6.042963902381328
If I had been able said she to carry my point of going to Brighton with all my family would not have happened but poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her	26.826957952797255
Why did the Forsters ever let her go out of their sight	4913.599025871819
I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after	29.552092352028872
I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but I was over ruled as I always am	149.24955450518294
Poor dear child	19.280007499081826
And now heres Mr Bennet gone away and I know he will fight Wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all	32.74549162877729
The Collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother I do not know what we shall do They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and Mr Gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in London the very next day and would assist Mr Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia	4.460162165376301
Do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain	46.415888336127786
In a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost	20.691380811147894
As soon as I get to town I shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to Gracechurch Street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done Oh	20.691380811147894
my dear brother replied Mrs Bennet that is exactly what I could most wish for	1333.521432163324
And now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already them marry	100.00000000000001
And as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses to buy them after they are married	36.51741272548377
And above all things keep Mr Bennet from fighting	2525.580331332133
Tell him what a dreadful state I am in that I am frightened out of my wits and have such tremblings such flutterings all over me such spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that I can get no rest by night nor by day	8.778013135972484
And tell my dear Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses	52.983169062837085
Oh brother how kind you are	627.2367209905697
Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject	4.548777947003777
In the dining room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before	61.05402296585327
One came from her books and the other from her toilette	3948.657331669654
But we must stem the tide of malice and pour into the wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation Then perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying she added Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply	2.7953009456081994
Mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them	599.4842503189408
After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which Elizabeth considered as all but certain and Miss Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying But tell me all and every thing about it which I have not already heard	9.152473108773892
Give me farther particulars	97.91709669801119
What did Colonel Forster say	264.0029742293326
I am so grieved for him	505.94976898274456
His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost	2390.6215493862082
Did he know of their intending to go off	2390.6215493862082
Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself Yes but when questioned by Denny denied knowing any thing of their plan and would not give his real opinion about it	52.983169062837085
He did not repeat his persuasion of their not marrying and from I am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before And till Colonel Forster came himself not one of you entertained a doubt I suppose of their being really married How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains	7.813707376518094
I felt a little uneasy a little fearful of my sisters happiness with him in marriage because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite right	52.983169062837085
Kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in Lydias last letter she had prepared her for such a step	46.415888336127786
He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant	1240.0188813517789
But to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable	428.1332398719392
We acted with the best intentions Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydias note to his wife He brought it with him for us to see Jane then took it from her pocket book and gave it to Elizabeth	16.57723885589317
These were the contents MY DEAR HARRIET You will laugh when you know where I am gone and I cannot help laughing myself at your surprise to morrow morning as soon as I am missed	24.484367468222267
I am going to Gretna Green and if you cannot guess with who I shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world I love and he is an angel	24.484367468222267
I should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off	1333.521432163324
You need not send them word at Longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when I write to them and sign my name Lydia Wickham	22.456979955397745
I can hardly write for laughing	570.3383117851288
Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him to night	599.4842503189408
Tell him I hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him I will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure	46.415888336127786
Good bye	1.284857555844875
Give my love to Colonel Forster I hope you will drink to our good journey	1333.521432163324
Your affectionate friend LYDIA BENNET Oh	627.2367209905697
thoughtless thoughtless Lydia cried Elizabeth when she had finished it	2543.5771905025967
But at least it shews that was serious in the object of her journey	2154.4346900318833
Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a of infamy	873.3261623828432
how he must have felt it I never saw any one so shocked	3727.5937203149383
He could not speak a word for full ten minutes	2750.122539625758
My mother was taken ill immediately and the whole house in such confusion Oh	2154.4346900318833
Jane cried Elizabeth was there a servant belonging to it who did not know the whole story before the end of the day I do not know I hope there was But to be guarded at such a time is very difficult	14.547578108480476
My mother was in hysterics and though I endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power I am afraid I did not do so much as I might have done	36.51741272548377
Oh	1.2848575558448747
that I had been with you you have had every care and anxiety upon yourself alone Mary and Kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue I am sure but I did not think it right for either of them	12.91549665014884
My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on Tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me	100.00000000000001
She was of great use and comfort to us all and lady Lucas has been very kind she walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they could be of use to us She had better have stayed at home cried Elizabeth perhaps she well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of ones neighbours	4.948168092155143
Assistance is impossible condolence insufferable	289.3073146308603
Let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied She then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had intended to pursue while in town for the recovery of his daughter	24.484367468222267
He meant I believe replied Jane to go to Epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if any thing could be made out from them	36.51741272548377
His principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham	428.1332398719392
If he could any how discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach	16.57723885589317
I do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that I had difficulty in finding out even so much as this CHAPTER VI	14.547578108480476
The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr Bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him	61.05402296585327
His family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion	71.09709432312432
They were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send but even of they would have been glad to be certain	100.00000000000001
Mr Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off	5054.080905121878
When he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on Mr Bennet to return to Longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husbands not being killed in a duel	6.40400427119728
Mrs Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces	71.09709432312432
She shared in their attendance on Mrs Bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom	240.40991835099712
Their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them up though as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of Wickhams extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them	10.0
All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light	240.40991835099712
He was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesmans family	41.011270705513006
Every body declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and every body began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness	41.011270705513006
Elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin still more certain and even Jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to Scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them	4.840960141478948
Mr Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday on Tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch street	20.691380811147894
That Mr Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town as Mr Bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to London before they procured lodgings	7.2789538439831505
Mr Gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it	61.05402296585327
He added that Mr Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London and promised to write again very soon	240.40991835099712
There was also a postscript to this effect	1446.789589842854
I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young mans intimates in the regiment whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself	10.481131341546856
At present we have nothing to guide us	1582.8602159467669
But on second thoughts perhaps Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved	7.813707376518094
She had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years	121.15276586285881
It was possible however that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to	19.14481976169958
Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected	121.15276586285881
Through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance	71.09709432312432
But before they heard again from Mr Gardiner a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from Mr Collins which as Jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read and Elizabeth who knew what curiosities his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise	7.2789538439831505
It was as follows MY DEAR SIR I feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from Hertfordshire	12.91549665014884
No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortune or that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others most afflicting to a parents mind	24.484367468222267
The death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this	2154.4346900318833
And it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and Mrs Bennet I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age	4.3754793750741845
They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady Catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family	19.14481976169958
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last November for had it been otherwise I must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace	26.826957952797255
Let me advise you then my dear Sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offence	19.14481976169958
I am dear Sir c	289.3073146308603
c Mr Gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from Colonel Forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send	61.05402296585327
It was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living	52.983169062837085
His former acquaintance had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them	41.011270705513006
There was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him	428.1332398719392
And in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by Lydias relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount	12.216773489967919
Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expences at Brighton	428.1332398719392
He owed a good deal in the town but his debts of honour were still more formidable	599.4842503189408
Mr Gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family Jane heard them with horror	428.1332398719392
A gamester she cried	97.91709669801119
This is wholly unexpected	97.91709669801119
I had not an idea of it Mr Gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day which was Saturday	41.011270705513006
Rendered spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours he had yielded to his brother in laws intreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit	12.91549665014884
When Mrs Bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before	52.983169062837085
What is he coming home and without poor Lydia she cried	4106.961080865378
Sure he will not leave London before he has found them	3885.3446126838194
Who is to fight Wickham and make him marry her if he comes away As Mrs Gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and her children should go to London at the same time that Mr Bennet came from it	11.583232862547103
The coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to Longbourn	428.1332398719392
Mrs Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her Derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world	100.00000000000001
His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of half expectation which Mrs Gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing	22.456979955397745
Elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from Pemberley	5125.616880269244
The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from though Elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of Darcy she could have borne the dread of Lydias infamy somewhat better	6.601948484081891
It would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two	3727.5937203149383
When Mr Bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure	2154.4346900318833
He said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it	17.782794100389232
Who should suffer but myself	289.3073146308603
It has been my own doing and I ought to feel it You must not be too severe upon yourself replied Elizabeth	149.24955450518294
You may well warn me against such an evil	2262.8745249117715
Human nature is so prone to fall into it	2525.580331332133
I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression	2222.393068975667
It will pass away soon enough Do you suppose them to be in London Yes where else can they be so well concealed And Lydia used to want to go to London added Kitty	26.826957952797255
She is happy then said her father drily and her residence there will probably be of some duration Then after a short silence he continued Lizzy I bear you no ill will for being justified in your advice to me last May which considering the event shews some greatness of mind They were interrupted by Miss Bennet who came to fetch her mothers tea	5.878016072274914
This is a parade cried he which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune	599.4842503189408
Another day I will do the same I will sit in my library in my night cap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as I can or perhaps I may defer it till Kitty runs away I am not going to run away Papa said Kitty fretfully if should ever go to Brighton I would behave better than Lydia go to Brighton I would not trust you so near it as East Bourne for fifty pounds	4.294487988789274
No Kitty I have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it	428.1332398719392
No officer is ever to enter my house again nor even to pass through the village	873.3261623828432
Balls will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters	2154.4346900318833
If you are a good girl for the next ten years I will take you to a review at the end of them CHAPTER VII	83.76776400682921
Two days after Mr Bennets return as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to Miss Bennet I beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so I took the liberty of coming to ask What do you mean Hill	3.4034148825183075
We have heard nothing from town Dear madam cried Mrs Hill in great astonishment dont you know there is an express come for master from Mr Gardiner	61.05402296585327
He has been here this half hour and master has had a letter Away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech	61.05402296585327
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast room from thence to the library their father was in neither and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the butler who said If you are looking for my master maam he is walking towards the little copse Upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock	3.4485331776221058
Jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out Oh Papa what news	20.691380811147894
have you heard from my uncle Yes I have had a letter from him by express Well and what news does it bring	121.15276586285881
good or bad What is there of good to be expected said he taking the letter from his pocket but perhaps you would like to read it Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand	26.826957952797255
Jane now came up	97.91709669801119
Read it aloud said their father for I hardly know myself what it is about Gracechurch street Monday August	316.227766016838
MY DEAR BROTHER At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole I hope will give you satisfaction	52.983169062837085
It is enough to know they are discovered I have seen them both Then it is as I always hoped cried Jane they are married Elizabeth read on I have seen them both	29.552092352028872
They are not married nor can I find there was any intention of being so but if you are willing to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your side I hope it will not be long before they are	13.68874509537081
All that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per annum	8.778013135972484
These are conditions which considering every thing I had no hesitation in complying with as far as I thought myself privileged for you	121.15276586285881
I shall send this by express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer	599.4842503189408
You will easily comprehend from these particulars that Mr Wickhams circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be	149.24955450518294
The world has been deceived in that respect and I am happy to say there will be some little money even when all his debts are discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune	19.14481976169958
There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again therefore stay quietly at Longbourn and depend on my diligence and care	83.76776400682921
Send back your answer as soon as you can and be careful to write explicitly	1333.521432163324
We have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house of which I hope you will approve	187.38174228603845
I shall write again as soon as any thing more is determined on	3727.5937203149383
Yours c	1.284857555844875
GARDINER Is it possible cried Elizabeth when she had finished	2543.5771905025967
No but it must be done soon Most earnestly did she then intreat him to lose no more time before he wrote	149.24955450518294
Oh	1.2848575558448747
my dear father she cried come back and write immediately	3038.8994495021866
Consider how important every moment is in such a case Let me write for you said Jane if you dislike the trouble yourself I dislike it very much he replied but it must be done And so saying he turned back with them and walked towards the house	10.481131341546856
And may I ask said Elizabeth but the terms I suppose must be complied with Complied with	599.4842503189408
Yet he is a man Yes yes they must marry	2870.82815195103
But there are two things that I want very much to know one is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how I am ever to pay him Money	20.691380811147894
my uncle cried Jane what do you mean Sir I mean that no man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a year during my life and fifty after I am gone That is very true said Elizabeth though it had not occurred to me before	8.431909292866257
it must be my uncles doings	503.1666397469999
Generous good man I am afraid he has distressed himself	2321.7423791048545
A small sum could not do all this No said her father Wickhams a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds	61.05402296585327
I should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very beginning of our relationship Ten thousand pounds	240.40991835099712
Heaven forbid	1.284857555844875
How is half such a sum to be repaid Mr Bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house	52.983169062837085
Their father then went to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfast room	599.4842503189408
And they are really to be married cried Elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves	873.3261623828432
How strange this is	97.91709669801119
Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or any thing like it has been advanced	83.76776400682921
He has children of his own and may have more	2484.60885690987
How could he spare half ten thousand pounds If we are ever able to learn what Wickhams debts have been said Elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what Mr Gardiner has done for them because Wickham has not sixpence of his own	8.778013135972484
The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited	2941.0328351639037
Their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge	71.09709432312432
By this time she is actually with them	1655.8735216287728
If such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy	873.3261623828432
What a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said Jane I hope and trust they will yet be happy	26.826957952797255
Their mutual affection will steady them and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten Their conduct has been such replied Elizabeth as neither you nor I nor any body can ever forget	10.0
It is useless to talk of it It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened	71.09709432312432
They went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her	149.24955450518294
After a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud	5125.616880269244
Mrs Bennet could hardly contain herself	522.3380814038474
As soon as Jane had read Mr Gardiners hope of Lydias being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance	71.09709432312432
She was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation	240.40991835099712
To know that her daughter would be married was enough	2779.399917586941
She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct	599.4842503189408
My dear dear Lydia she cried This is delightful indeed She will be married I shall see her again She will be married at sixteen My good kind brother I knew how it would be I knew he would manage every thing	14.547578108480476
How I long to see her	378.8831198241203
and to see dear Wickham too	579.9085843097012
But the clothes the wedding clothes	627.2367209905697
I will write to my sister Gardiner about them directly	3228.4752973329614
Lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her	599.4842503189408
Stay stay I will go myself	570.3383117851288
I will put on my things in a moment	2219.585546854552
My dear dear Lydia How merry we shall be together when we meet Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr Gardiners behaviour laid them all under	14.547578108480476
We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr Wickham with money Well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle	36.51741272548377
If he had not had a family of his own I and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had any thing from him except a few presents	16.57723885589317
Well	1.2848575558448747
I am so happy	72.47777034016192
Mrs Wickham	1.284857555844875
How well it sounds	97.91709669801119
And she was only sixteen last June	1022.712713897267
My dear Jane I am in such a flutter that I am sure I cant write so I will dictate and you write for me	83.76776400682921
One days delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual	121.15276586285881
Other schemes too came into her head	1120.6900652727268
And as I come back I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs Long	2154.4346900318833
Oh	1.2848575558448747
here comes Hill	19.280007499081826
My dear Hill have you heard the good news	2347.3383439049167
Miss Lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding Mrs Hill began instantly to express her joy	41.011270705513006
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom	83.76776400682921
Poor Lydias situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful	187.38174228603845
She felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained	12.91549665014884
CHAPTER VIII	1.284857555844875
Mr Bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him	15.505157798326243
He now wished it more than ever	1046.3393929311092
Had he done his duty in that respect Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her	46.415888336127786
He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to any one should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother in law and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could	9.55855309468529
When first Mr Bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son	149.24955450518294
This son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for	36.51741272548377
Five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and Mrs Bennet for many years after Lydias birth had been certain that he would	52.983169062837085
This event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving	599.4842503189408
Mrs Bennet had no turn for economy and her husbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income	240.40991835099712
But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents	428.1332398719392
In terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him	15.505157798326243
He had never before supposed that could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement	41.011270705513006
He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mothers hands Lydias expences had been very little within that sum	9.55855309468529
That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his chief wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible	24.484367468222267
His letter was soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution	599.4842503189408
He begged to know farther particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her	71.09709432312432
It was borne in the latter with decent philosophy	2262.8745249117715
But there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the good natured wishes for her well doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton lost but little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain	8.431909292866257
It was a fortnight since Mrs Bennet had been down stairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high	32.74549162877729
No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph	3393.7481503500094
The marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since Jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants	12.216773489967919
She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance	32.74549162877729
Haye Park might do said she if the Gouldings would quit it or the great house at Stoke if the drawing room were larger but Ashworth is too far off	41.011270705513006
I could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for Purvis Lodge the attics are dreadful Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained	29.552092352028872
Into house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance	3228.475297332962
I will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at Longbourn A long dispute followed this declaration but Mr Bennet was firm it soon led to another and Mrs Bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter	9.152473108773892
He protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion	873.3261623828432
Mrs Bennet could hardly comprehend it	522.3380814038474
That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all that she could believe possible	24.484367468222267
She was more alive to the disgrace which the want of new clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took place	19.14481976169958
Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make Mr Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot	6.601948484081891
She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means	4147.021935625597
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sisters frailty would have mortified her so much	26.826957952797255
Had Lydias marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that Mr Darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned	9.55855309468529
From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink	3570.856299289651
She became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it	599.4842503189408
She wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence	1333.521432163324
She was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet	240.40991835099712
He was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex	2154.4346900318833
But while he was mortal there must be a triumph	2702.253319945294
His understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes	2154.4346900318833
It was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgment information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance	12.216773489967919
An union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family	187.38174228603845
How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine	1333.521432163324
But how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture	52.983169062837085
Mr Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother	1417.7137660480676
To Mr Bennets acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurances of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with intreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again	24.484367468222267
The principal purport of his letter was to inform them that Mr Wickham had resolved on quitting the Militia	316.227766016838
It was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as his marriage was fixed on	240.40991835099712
And I think you will agree with me in considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my nieces	83.76776400682921
It is Mr Wickhams intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army	41.011270705513006
He has the promise of an ensigncy in General s regiment now quartered in the North	873.3261623828432
It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom	1333.521432163324
He promises fairly and I hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent	100.00000000000001
I have written to Colonel Forster to inform him of our present arrangements and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr Wickham in and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which I have pledged myself	15.505157798326243
And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his information	61.05402296585327
He has given in all his debts I hope at least he has not deceived us	873.3261623828432
Haggerston has our directions and all will be completed in a week	5125.616880269244
They will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to Longbourn and I understand from Mrs Gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the South	26.826957952797255
She is well and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her mother Yours c	873.3261623828432
E	1.2848575558448747
GARDINER Mr Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickhams removal from the shire as clearly as Mr Gardiner could do	121.15276586285881
But Mrs Bennet was not so well pleased with it	2031.3849215489865
Lydias being settled in the North just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body and had so many favourites	5.878016072274914
But Jane and Elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sisters feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her and her husband at Longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished	5.4361836201538365
When Mr Bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to Longbourn	26.826957952797255
Elizabeth was surprised however that Wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes	29.552092352028872
CHAPTER IX	1.284857555844875
Their sisters wedding day arrived and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself	316.227766016838
Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets and Jane more especially who gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had been the culprit was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure	19.14481976169958
They came	1.284857555844875
Smiles decked the face of Mrs Bennet as the carriage drove up to the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy	83.76776400682921
Lydias voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and she ran into the room	428.1332398719392
Her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to Wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness	17.782794100389232
Their reception from Mr Bennet to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial	1333.521432163324
His countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcely opened his lips	5346.783134922081
The easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him	3727.5937203149383
Elizabeth was disgusted and even Miss Bennet was shocked	2295.539085361908
Lydia was Lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisy and fearless	3393.7481503500094
Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all	12.91549665014884
Elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man	36.51741272548377
There was no want of discourse	522.3380814038474
They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world	3727.5937203149383
Nothing of the past was recollected with pain and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world	83.76776400682921
Only think of its being three months she cried since I went away it seems but a fortnight I declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time	36.51741272548377
when I went away I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came back again	240.40991835099712
though I thought it would be very good fun if I was Her father lifted up his eyes	428.1332398719392
mamma do the people here abouts know I am married to day	5125.616880269244
I was afraid they might not and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle so I was determined he should know it and so I let down the side glass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then I bowed and smiled like any thing Elizabeth could bear it no longer	5.0608719869196825
She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mothers right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister Ah	52.983169062837085
Jane I take your place now and you must go lower because I am a married woman It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first	16.57723885589317
Her ease and good spirits increased	579.9085843097012
She longed to see Mrs Philips the Lucases and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called Mrs Wickham by each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married to Mrs Hill and the two housemaids	10.0
Well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast room and what do you think of my husband	187.38174228603845
I am sure my sisters must all envy me	1689.2431499825452
I only hope they may have half my good luck	3071.2511016511903
They must all go to Brighton	533.172490546975
That is the place to get husbands	976.9214157645
What a pity it is mamma we did not all go Very true and if I had my will we should	187.38174228603845
But my dear Lydia I dont at all like your going such a way off	1333.521432163324
yes there is nothing in that	518.6013174997152
I shall like it of all things	976.9214157645
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter and I dare say there will be some balls and I will take care to get good partners for them all I should like it beyond any thing said her mother	17.782794100389232
And then when you go away you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over I thank you for my share of the favour said Elizabeth but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them	5.722367659350217
Mr Wickham had received his commission before he left London and he was to join his regiment at the end of a fortnight	121.15276586285881
No one but Mrs Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home	26.826957952797255
These parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not	83.76776400682921
Wickhams affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to Lydias for him	316.227766016838
She had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion	3.75588809068008
Lydia was exceedingly fond of him	627.2367209905697
He was her dear Wickham on every occasion no one was to be put in competition with him	428.1332398719392
One morning soon after their arrival as she was sitting with her two elder sisters she said to Elizabeth Lizzy I never gave an account of my wedding I believe	41.011270705513006
You were not by when I told mamma and the others all about it	2154.4346900318833
Are not you curious to hear how it was managed No really replied Elizabeth I think there cannot be too little said on the subject La	71.09709432312432
You are so strange	97.91709669801119
But I must tell you how it went off	2004.0145275309874
We were married you know at St	1120.6900652727268
Clements because Wickhams lodgings were in that parish	1760.060344050462
My uncle and aunt and I were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church	240.40991835099712
Well Monday morning came and I was in such a fuss	3041.1572992471965
I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then I should have gone quite distracted	149.24955450518294
And there was my aunt all the time I was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon	121.15276586285881
However I did not hear above one word in ten for I was thinking you may suppose of my dear Wickham	187.38174228603845
Well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual I thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them	17.782794100389232
To be sure London was rather thin but however the little Theatre was open	2154.4346900318833
Well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man Mr Stone	100.00000000000001
And then you know when once they get together there is no end of it	1333.521432163324
Well I was so frightened I did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day	26.826957952797255
But luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out	873.3261623828432
However I recollected afterwards that if he been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for Mr Darcy might have done as well Mr Darcy repeated Elizabeth in utter amazement	32.74549162877729
Oh yes he was to come there with Wickham you know	3603.286979118953
I ought not to have said a word about it	2250.1405534171395
I promised them so faithfully	289.3073146308603
What will Wickham say	97.91709669801119
It was to be such a secret If it was to be secret said Jane say not another word on the subject	149.24955450518294
You may depend upon my seeking no further Oh	2041.178326936229
certainly said Elizabeth though burning with curiosity we will ask you no questions Thank you said Lydia for if you did I should certainly tell you all and then Wickham would be angry On such encouragement to ask Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power by running away	9.152473108773892
Mr Darcy had been at her sisters wedding	1138.2272140411244
It was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go	187.38174228603845
Those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable	873.3261623828432
You may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time	19.14481976169958
Pray write instantly and let me understand it unless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance Not that I though she added to herself as she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out Janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall Elizabeth was glad of it till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante	2.631286073895943
CHAPTER X	1.284857555844875
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could	599.4842503189408
She was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial	9.55855309468529
	1.2848575558448747
MY DEAR NIECE I have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as I foresee that a writing will not comprise what I have to tell you	29.552092352028872
I must confess myself surprised by your application I did not expect it from	2154.4346900318833
Dont think me angry however for I only mean to let you know that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on side	83.76776400682921
If you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence	3306.141520069558
Your uncle is as much surprised as I am and nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done	41.011270705513006
But if you are really innocent and ignorant I must be more explicit	3727.5937203149383
On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor	599.4842503189408
Mr Darcy called and was shut up with him several hours	3961.512542590339
It was all over before I arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as seems to have been	240.40991835099712
He came to tell Mr Gardiner that he had found out where your sister and Mr Wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both Wickham repeatedly Lydia once	32.74549162877729
The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that Wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him	19.14481976169958
He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world	52.983169062837085
His character was to speak for itself	1046.3393929311092
If he motive I am sure it would never disgrace him	2790.5570417148424
He had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us	15.505157798326243
There is a lady it seems a Mrs Younge who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what	24.484367468222267
This Mrs Younge was he knew intimately acquainted with Wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town	71.09709432312432
She would not betray her trust I suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found	100.00000000000001
Wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in London and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her	32.74549162877729
At length however our kind friend procured the wished for direction	3829.76906463376
They were in street	87.7319564626089
He saw Wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia	2525.580331332133
She cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving Wickham	240.40991835099712
Since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with Wickham he easily learnt had never been design	36.51741272548377
He meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it	240.40991835099712
Mr Darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once	3727.5937203149383
Though Mr Bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage	46.415888336127786
But he found in reply to this question that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country	71.09709432312432
Under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief	599.4842503189408
They met several times for there was much to be discussed	3691.1133208722817
Wickham of course wanted more than he could get but at length was reduced to be reasonable	599.4842503189408
Every thing being settled between Mr Darcys next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in Gracechurch street the evening before I came home	41.011270705513006
But Mr Gardiner could not be seen and Mr Darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning	52.983169062837085
He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former	32.74549162877729
He did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business	149.24955450518294
On Saturday he came again	289.3073146308603
They met again on Sunday and then saw him too	3393.7481503500094
I fancy Lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all	2154.4346900318833
He has been accused of many faults at different times but is the true one	1333.521432163324
Nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though I am sure and I do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole	19.14481976169958
They battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved	187.38174228603845
But at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and I really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due	4.738879609717654
But Lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or Jane at most	3727.5937203149383
You know pretty well I suppose what has been done for the young people	2154.4346900318833
The reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as I have given above	316.227766016838
It was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that Wickhams character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was	32.74549162877729
Perhaps there was some truth in though I doubt whether reserve or reserve can be answerable for the event	316.227766016838
But in spite of all this fine talking my dear Lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for in the affair	26.826957952797255
When all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at Pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in London once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish	11.583232862547103
It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise I hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure	83.76776400682921
Lydia came to us and Wickham had constant admission to the house	4845.022090449283
I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family	36.51741272548377
I was sometimes quite provoked but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane and for their sakes had patience with her	149.24955450518294
Mr Darcy was punctual in his return and as Lydia informed you attended the wedding	1333.521432163324
Will you be very angry with me my dear Lizzy if I take this opportunity of saying what I was never bold enough to say before how much I like him	36.51741272548377
His behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire	599.4842503189408
His understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and if he marry his wife may teach him	100.00000000000001
I thought him very sly he hardly ever mentioned your name	4341.218347705809
But slyness seems the fashion	289.3073146308603
Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from P	100.00000000000001
But I must write no more	579.9085843097012
GARDINER The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share	52.983169062837085
The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr Darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true	6.40400427119728
Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her	3000.2985096460466
But it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for her for a woman who had already refused him as able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with Wickham	9.152473108773892
Brother in law of Wickham	264.0029742293326
He had to be sure done much	891.4838872153653
She was ashamed to think how much	962.7998464150356
But he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief	873.3261623828432
It was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return	187.38174228603845
They owed the restoration of Lydia her character every thing to him	4913.599025871819
Oh	1.2848575558448747
how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him	149.24955450518294
For herself she was humbled but she was proud of him	3483.5703121748743
Proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself	316.227766016838
She read over her aunts commendation of him again and again	3772.0214140706903
It was hardly enough but it pleased her	1760.060344050462
She was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between Mr Darcy and herself	29.552092352028872
She was roused from her seat and her reflections by some ones approach and before she could strike into another path she was overtaken by Wickham	71.09709432312432
I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble my dear sister said he as he joined her	599.4842503189408
You certainly do she replied with a smile but it does not follow that the interruption must be unwelcome I should be sorry indeed if it were	61.05402296585327
were always good friends and now we are better True	3228.4752973329614
Are the others coming out I do not know	1405.642010331944
Mrs Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to Meryton	3357.639924020029
And so my dear sister I find from our uncle and aunt that you have actually seen Pemberley She replied in the affirmative	121.15276586285881
I almost envy you the pleasure and yet I believe it would be too much for me or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle	52.983169062837085
Poor Reynolds she was always very fond of me	2236.6682813018356
But of course she did not mention my name to you Yes she did And what did she say That you were gone into the army and she was afraid had not turned out well	24.484367468222267
At such a distance as you know things are strangely misrepresented Certainly he replied biting his lips	599.4842503189408
Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him but he soon afterwards said I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month	187.38174228603845
We passed each other several times	627.2367209905697
It must be something particular to take him there at this time of year Undoubtedly	1333.521432163324
Did you see him while you were at Lambton	2390.6215493862082
I thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had Yes he introduced us to his sister And do you like her Very much I have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two	19.14481976169958
When I last saw her she was not very promising	2497.5082187292687
I am very glad you liked her	777.0810903233812
I hope she will turn out well I dare say she will she has got over the most trying age Did you go by the village of Kympton I do not recollect that we did I mention it because it is the living which I ought to have had	10.0
A most delightful place Excellent Parsonage House	1120.6900652727268
It would have suited me in every respect How should you have liked making sermons Exceedingly well	599.4842503189408
I should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing	428.1332398719392
One ought not to repine but to be sure it would have been such a thing for me	428.1332398719392
The quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness	873.3261623828432
But it was not to be	224.02965589362952
Yes there was something in I told you so from the first you may remember I hear too that there was a time when sermon making was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised accordingly You did	6.812920690579612
and it was not wholly without foundation	551.8580307202016
You may remember what I told you on that point when first we talked of it They were now almost at the door of the house for she had walked fast to get rid of him and unwilling for her sisters sake to provoke him she only said in reply with a good humoured smile Come Mr Wickham we are brother and sister you know	5.722367659350217
In future I hope we shall be always of one mind She held out her hand he kissed it with affectionate gallantry though he hardly knew how to look and they entered the house	26.826957952797255
CHAPTER XI	1.284857555844875
Mr Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet	14.547578108480476
Oh	1.2848575558448747
my dear Lydia she cried when shall we meet again Oh lord	4626.689667912174
I dont know	19.280007499081826
Not these two or three years perhaps Write to me very often my dear As often as I can	316.227766016838
But you know married women have never much time for writing	4147.021935625597
My sisters may write to	289.3073146308603
He smiled looked handsome and said many pretty things	2525.580331332133
He is as fine a fellow said Mr Bennet as soon as they were out of the house as ever I saw	149.24955450518294
He simpers and smirks and makes love to us all	3194.4674919357367
I defy even Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son in law The loss of her daughter made Mrs Bennet very dull for several days	52.983169062837085
One seems so forlorn without them This is the consequence you see Madam of marrying a daughter said Elizabeth	316.227766016838
It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single It is no such thing	599.4842503189408
Lydia does not leave me because she is married but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off	187.38174228603845
If that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation	11.006941712522094
The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks	41.011270705513006
She looked at Jane and smiled and shook her head by turns	4208.744145437986
Well well and so Mr Bingley is coming down sister for Mrs Philips first brought her the news Well so much the better	121.15276586285881
Not that I care about it though	928.5963181931988
He is nothing to us you know and I am sure never want to see him again	599.4842503189408
But however he is very welcome to come to Netherfield if he likes it	2154.4346900318833
And who knows what happen	289.3073146308603
But that is nothing to us	474.95532318081933
You know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it	2154.4346900318833
And so is it quite certain he is coming You may depend on it replied the other for Mrs Nicholls was in Meryton last night I saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true	9.152473108773892
He comes down on Thursday at the latest very likely on Wednesday	5346.783134922081
She was going to the butchers she told me on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour	12.216773489967919
It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said I saw you look at me to day Lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and I know I appeared distressed	11.006941712522094
But dont imagine it was from any silly cause	2390.6215493862082
I was only confused for the moment because I felt that I be looked at	1333.521432163324
I do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain	873.3261623828432
Not that I am afraid of but I dread other peoples remarks Elizabeth did not know what to make of it	187.38174228603845
I leave him to himself In spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it	22.456979955397745
The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents about a twelvemonth ago was now brought forward again	240.40991835099712
As soon as ever Mr Bingley comes my dear said Mrs Bennet you will wait on him of course No no	187.38174228603845
You forced me into visiting him last year and promised if I went to see him he should marry one of my daughters	121.15276586285881
But it ended in nothing and I will not be sent on a fools errand again His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen on his returning to Netherfield	17.782794100389232
He knows where we live	289.3073146308603
But however that shant prevent my asking him to dine here I am determined	2154.4346900318833
We must have Mrs Long and the Gouldings soon	2390.6215493862082
As the day of his arrival drew near I begin to be sorry that he comes at all said Jane to her sister	121.15276586285881
It would be nothing I could see him with perfect indifference but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of	121.15276586285881
My mother means well but she does not know no one can know how much I suffer from what she says	187.38174228603845
Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over I wish I could say any thing to comfort you replied Elizabeth but it is wholly out of my power	36.51741272548377
You must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much Mr Bingley arrived	71.09709432312432
Mrs Bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could	32.74549162877729
She counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before	428.1332398719392
But on the third morning after his arrival in Hertfordshire she saw him from her dressing room window enter the paddock and ride towards the house	71.09709432312432
Jane resolutely kept her place at the table but Elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the window she looked she saw Mr Darcy with him and sat down again by her sister	29.552092352028872
Mr Darcy and so it does I vow	1436.1403025717718
She knew but little of their meeting in Derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter	29.552092352028872
Both sisters were uncomfortable enough	289.3073146308603
Each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of Mr Darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as Mr Bingleys friend without being heard by either of them	15.505157798326243
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by Jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs Gardiners letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him	22.456979955397745
To Jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley	5.4361836201538365
Her astonishment at his coming at his coming to Netherfield to Longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in Derbyshire	29.552092352028872
The colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken	12.216773489967919
But she would not be secure	368.7888167650497
Jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected	2154.4346900318833
On the gentlemens appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance	36.51741272548377
Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command	71.09709432312432
He looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire than as she had seen him at Pemberley	71.09709432312432
But perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt	428.1332398719392
It was a painful but not an improbable conjecture	2121.4970082940417
Bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed	240.40991835099712
Darcy after enquiring of her how Mr and Mrs Gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely any thing	100.00000000000001
There he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself	3727.5937203149383
But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at Jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground	10.481131341546856
More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed	1333.521432163324
Could I expect it to be otherwise said she	1922.5889562844839
Yet why did he come She was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself and to him she had hardly courage to speak	71.09709432312432
She enquired after his sister but could do no more	3393.7481503500094
It is a long time Mr Bingley since you went away said Mrs Bennet	2154.4346900318833
He readily agreed to it	264.0029742293326
I began to be afraid you would never come back again	3615.0178056337836
A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away	3727.5937203149383
Miss Lucas is married and settled	627.2367209905697
I suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers	873.3261623828432
It was only said Lately George Wickham Esq	1760.060344050462
It was my brother Gardiners drawing up too and I wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it	149.24955450518294
Elizabeth dared not lift up her eyes	941.0595171310952
How Mr Darcy looked therefore she could not tell	1624.8024832464487
They are gone down to Newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay I do not know how long	100.00000000000001
His regiment is there for I suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars	121.15276586285881
Thank Heaven	1.284857555844875
he has friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves Elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at Mr Darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat	26.826957952797255
It drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present	29.552092352028872
A few weeks he believed	289.3073146308603
When you have killed all your own birds Mr Bingley said her mother I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr Bennets manor	41.011270705513006
I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the covies for you Elizabeths misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention	36.51741272548377
Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion	46.415888336127786
At that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion	149.24955450518294
The first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them	187.38174228603845
Their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this	2154.4346900318833
Let me never see either one or the other again Yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister re kindled the admiration of her former lover	12.216773489967919
He found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty	149.24955450518294
When the gentlemen rose to go away Mrs Bennet was mindful of her intended civility and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time	41.011270705513006
They then went away	87.7319564626089
CHAPTER XII	1.284857555844875
As soon as they were gone Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more	46.415888336127786
Mr Darcys behaviour astonished and vexed her	1120.6900652727268
Why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she did he come at all She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure	46.415888336127786
If he fears me why come hither	1120.6900652727268
If he no longer cares for me why silent	2525.580331332133
Teazing teazing man	19.280007499081826
I will think no more about him Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which shewed her better satisfied with their visitors than Elizabeth	17.782794100389232
Now said she that this first meeting is over I feel perfectly easy	3727.5937203149383
I know my own strength and I shall never be embarrassed again by his coming	1333.521432163324
I am glad he dines here on Tuesday	1395.0139659747274
It will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance Yes very indifferent indeed said Elizabeth laughingly	83.76776400682921
On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen were in very good time	36.51741272548377
When they repaired to the dining room Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister	36.51741272548377
On entering the room he seemed to hesitate but Jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided	187.38174228603845
He placed himself by her	264.0029742293326
Elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend	2362.9358734847483
He bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr Darcy with an expression of half laughing alarm	19.14481976169958
His behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as shewed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded Elizabeth that if left wholly to himself Janes happiness and his own would be speedily secured	17.782794100389232
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour	428.1332398719392
He was on one side of her mother	1269.5223372421856
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage	428.1332398719392
Her mothers ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeths mind and she would at times have given any thing to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family	12.216773489967919
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance	13.68874509537081
Anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing room before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil	61.05402296585327
She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend	187.38174228603845
If he does not come to me said she I shall give him up for ever The gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas	26.826957952797255
We want none of them do we Darcy had walked away to another part of the room	599.4842503189408
She followed him with her eyes envied every one to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for being so silly	32.74549162877729
Is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman	149.24955450518294
Have all her friends left her Mrs Annesley is with her	4106.961080865378
When the tea things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mothers rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party	7.038135554931555
She now lost every expectation of pleasure	1046.3393929311092
They were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself	19.14481976169958
Mrs Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to supper but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the others and she had no opportunity of detaining them	36.51741272548377
Well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves What say you to the day	428.1332398719392
I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well I assure you	4483.207448854425
The venison was roasted to a turn and everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch	599.4842503189408
The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the Lucass last week and even Mr Darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done and I suppose he has two or three French cooks at least	17.782794100389232
And my dear Jane I never saw you look in greater beauty	4226.843938915197
Mrs Long said so too for I asked her whether you did not	3727.5937203149383
And what do you think she said besides	1245.6018898679397
Mrs Bennet we shall have her at Netherfield at last	3194.4674919357367
She did indeed	16.806655832511165
I do think Mrs Long is as good a creature as ever lived and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome I like them prodigiously Mrs Bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of Bingleys behaviour to Jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals	3.359818286283782
The party seemed so well selected so suitable one with the other	5346.783134922081
Lizzy you must not do so	482.9250698836312
It mortifies me	19.280007499081826
I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it	83.76776400682921
It is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man You are very cruel said her sister you will not let me smile and are provoking me to it every moment How hard it is in some cases to be believed And how impossible in others But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I acknowledge That is a question which I hardly know how to answer	3.814128748283214
We all love to instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing	1333.521432163324
Forgive me and if you persist in indifference do not make your confidante CHAPTER XIII	1333.521432163324
A few days after this visit Mr Bingley called again and alone	5346.783134922081
His friend had left him that morning for London but was to return home in ten days time	428.1332398719392
He sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits	3727.5937203149383
Mrs Bennet invited him to dine with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere	316.227766016838
Next time you call said she I hope we shall be more lucky He should be particularly happy at any time c	149.24955450518294
Can you come to morrow Yes he had no engagement at all for to morrow and her invitation was accepted with alacrity	149.24955450518294
He came and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed	873.3261623828432
In ran Mrs Bennet to her daughters room in her dressing gown and with her hair half finished crying out My dear Jane make haste and hurry down	52.983169062837085
Here Sarah come to Miss Bennet this moment and help her on with her gown	1333.521432163324
Never mind Miss Lizzys hair We will be down as soon as we can said Jane but I dare say Kitty is forwarder than either of us for she went up stairs half an hour ago Oh	20.691380811147894
hang Kitty	1.284857555844875
what has she to do with it	1120.6900652727268
Come be quick be quick	289.3073146308603
where is your sash my dear But when her mother was gone Jane would not be prevailed on to go down without one of her sisters	71.09709432312432
After tea Mr Bennet retired to the library as was his custom and Mary went up stairs to her instrument	240.40991835099712
Two obstacles of the five being thus removed Mrs Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them	52.983169062837085
Elizabeth would not observe her and when at last Kitty did she very innocently said What is the matter mamma	240.40991835099712
What do you keep winking at me for	1551.1173202083853
I did not wink at you She then sat still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to Kitty Come here my love I want to speak to you took her out of the room	12.216773489967919
In a few minutes Mrs Bennet half opened the door and called out Lizzy my dear I want to speak with you Elizabeth was forced to go	61.05402296585327
We may as well leave them by themselves you know said her mother as soon as she was in the hall	187.38174228603845
Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in my dressing room Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother but remained quietly in the hall till she and Kitty were out of sight then returned into the drawing room	15.505157798326243
Mrs Bennets schemes for this day were ineffectual	1760.060344050462
Bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter	2154.4346900318833
He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and Mrs Bennets means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband	24.484367468222267
After this day Jane said no more of her indifference	2685.261986931583
Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless Mr Darcy returned within the stated time	32.74549162877729
Seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentlemans concurrence	599.4842503189408
Bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and Mr Bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on	240.40991835099712
The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected	3071.2511016511903
There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him	26.826957952797255
Elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mothers schemes	16.57723885589317
But on returning to the drawing room when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her	32.74549162877729
On opening the door she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all	10.481131341546856
situation was awkward enough but she thought was still worse	3393.7481503500094
Not a syllable was uttered by either and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again when Bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room	13.68874509537081
Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world	41.011270705513006
Tis too much she added by far too much	2390.6215493862082
I do not deserve it	163.52528749900023
Oh	1.2848575558448747
why is not every body as happy Elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express	100.00000000000001
Every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane	4710.351154021535
But she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said for the present	149.24955450518294
I must go instantly to my mother she cried	2525.580331332133
I would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from any one but myself	149.24955450518294
He is gone to my father already	976.9214157645
Oh	1.2848575558448747
Lizzy to know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family	428.1332398719392
how shall I bear so much happiness She then hastened away to her mother who had purposely broken up the card party and was sitting up stairs with Kitty	46.415888336127786
Elizabeth who was left by herself now smiled at the rapidity and ease with which an affair was finally settled that had given them so many previous months of suspense and vexation	32.74549162877729
And this said she is the end of all his friends anxious circumspection	3727.5937203149383
of all his sisters falsehood and contrivance	1022.712713897267
Where is your sister said he hastily as he opened the door	4475.230401795965
With my mother up stairs	289.3073146308603
She will be down in a moment I dare say He then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister	46.415888336127786
They shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of Janes perfections and in spite of his being a lover Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and super excellent disposition of Jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself	4.3754793750741845
It was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of Miss Bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever	26.826957952797255
Kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon	4147.021935625597
Mrs Bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when Mr Bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly shewed how really happy he was	9.55855309468529
You will be a very happy woman Jane went to him instantly kissed him and thanked him for his goodness	240.40991835099712
You are a good girl he replied and I have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled	240.40991835099712
I have not a doubt of your doing very well together	2825.019466694797
Your tempers are by no means unlike	809.3558038208995
You are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income I hope not so	22.456979955397745
My dear Mr Bennet cried his wife what are you talking of	3966.424032770672
my dear dear Jane I am so happy	1274.9805570377707
I am sure I shant get a wink of sleep all night	3533.8831899253423
I knew how it would be	323.85087707085614
I always said it must be so at last	2011.7404464421224
I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing	2615.317365558663
he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen Wickham Lydia were all forgotten	1333.521432163324
Her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense	121.15276586285881
Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield and Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter	149.24955450518294
Bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept	11.006941712522094
Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur	12.216773489967919
In the absence of Jane he always attached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when Bingley was gone Jane constantly sought the same means of relief	36.51741272548377
I had not believed it possible I suspected as much replied Elizabeth	4425.069726846741
They were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which I cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects	61.05402296585327
But when they see as I trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other That is the most unforgiving speech said Elizabeth that I ever heard you utter	7.53690398089854
It would vex me indeed to see you again the dupe of Miss Bingleys pretended regard Would you believe it Lizzy that when he went to town last November he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again He made a little mistake to be sure but it is to the credit of his modesty This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities	3.75588809068008
Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him	16.57723885589317
I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed cried Jane	5346.783134922081
Oh	1.2848575558448747
If I could but see as happy	1120.6900652727268
If there but such another man for you If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you	83.76776400682921
Till I have your disposition your goodness I never can have your happiness	3727.5937203149383
No no let me shift for myself and perhaps if I have very good luck I may meet with another Mr Collins in time The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret	19.14481976169958
Mrs Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs Philips and ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton	83.76776400682921
The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world though only a few weeks before when Lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune	22.456979955397745
CHAPTER XIV	1.284857555844875
It was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours	121.15276586285881
The horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them	187.38174228603845
They both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered	71.09709432312432
They were of course all intending to be surprised but their astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of Mrs Bennet and Kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even inferior to what Elizabeth felt	19.14481976169958
She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to Elizabeths salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word	32.74549162877729
Mrs Bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness	240.40991835099712
After sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to Elizabeth I hope you are well Miss Bennet	240.40991835099712
That lady I suppose is your mother Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was	2154.4346900318833
And I suppose is one of your sisters Yes madam said Mrs Bennet delighted to speak to a lady Catherine	240.40991835099712
She is my youngest girl but one	1120.6900652727268
My youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man who I believe will soon become a part of the family You have a very small park here returned Lady Catherine after a short silence	12.216773489967919
It is nothing in comparison of Rosings my lady I dare say but I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucass This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening in summer the windows are full west Mrs Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner and then added May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr and Mrs Collins well Yes very well	4.460162165376301
I saw them the night before last Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from Charlotte as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling	41.011270705513006
Mrs Bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but Lady Catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating any thing and then rising up said to Elizabeth Miss Bennet there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness on one side of your lawn	9.152473108773892
I should be glad to take a turn in it if you will favour me with your company Go my dear cried her mother and shew her ladyship about the different walks	32.74549162877729
I think she will be pleased with the hermitage Elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest down stairs	71.09709432312432
Her carriage remained at the door and Elizabeth saw that her waiting woman was in it	873.3261623828432
They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable	26.826957952797255
How could I ever think her like her nephew said she as she looked in her face	599.4842503189408
As soon as they entered the copse Lady Catherine began in the following manner You can be at no loss Miss Bennet to understand the reason of my journey hither	41.011270705513006
I have not been at all able to account for the honour of seeing you here Miss Bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to know that I am not to be trifled with	20.691380811147894
But however insincere may choose to be you shall not find so	4710.351154021535
My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this I shall certainly not depart from it	61.05402296585327
A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago	4898.878950229736
I was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew Mr Darcy	17.782794100389232
Though I it must be a scandalous falsehood though I would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible I instantly resolved on setting off for this place that I might make my sentiments known to you If you believed it impossible to be true said Elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far	5.4361836201538365
do you then pretend to be ignorant of it	2103.1729119339934
Has it not been industriously circulated by yourselves	1655.8735216287728
Do you not know that such a report is spread abroad I never heard that it was And can you likewise declare that there is no for it I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship	17.782794100389232
may ask questions which shall not choose to answer This is not to be borne	1333.521432163324
Miss Bennet I insist on being satisfied	1022.712713897267
Has he has my nephew made you an offer of marriage Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible It ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his reason	22.456979955397745
You may have drawn him in If I have I shall be the last person to confess it Miss Bennet do you know who I am	71.09709432312432
I have not been accustomed to such language as this	2493.28602824728
I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns But you are not entitled to know nor will such behaviour as this ever induce me to be explicit Let me be rightly understood	12.91549665014884
This match to which you have the presumption to aspire can never take place	2154.4346900318833
No never	1.284857555844875
Mr Darcy is engaged to	192.00790248050393
From their infancy they have been intended for each other	3175.2922756799617
It was the favourite wish of mother as well as of hers	3943.100444826647
Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends	3691.1133208722817
To his tacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh	1328.1830742165841
Are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy	3020.6580511248785
But what is that to me	579.9085843097012
If there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew I shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry Miss De Bourgh	29.552092352028872
You both did as much as you could in planning the marriage	4237.780472703896
Its completion depended on others	289.3073146308603
If Mr Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice	187.38174228603845
And if I am that choice why may not I accept him Because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it	240.40991835099712
Yes Miss Bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all	83.76776400682921
But the wife of Mr Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine Obstinate headstrong girl	32.74549162877729
I am ashamed of you	289.3073146308603
Is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring	4341.218347705809
Is nothing due to me on that score	1760.060344050462
Let us sit down	97.91709669801119
You are to understand Miss Bennet that I came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will I be dissuaded from it	83.76776400682921
I have not been used to submit to any persons whims	2843.3190947820576
I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment will make your ladyships situation at present more pitiable but it will have no effect on I will not be interrupted	36.51741272548377
Hear me in silence	97.91709669801119
My daughter and my nephew are formed for each other	3175.2922756799617
Their fortune on both sides is splendid	1031.2143746216375
They are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them	149.24955450518294
The upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune	4599.483549134227
Is this to be endured	258.92699382537717
But it must not shall not be	890.3503893076473
If you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up In marrying your nephew I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere	22.456979955397745
You a gentlemans daughter	87.7319564626089
But who was your mother	289.3073146308603
Who are your uncles and aunts	627.2367209905697
Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition Whatever my connections may be said Elizabeth if your nephew does not object to them they can be nothing to Tell me once for all are you engaged to him Though Elizabeth would not for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine have answered this question she could not but say after a moments deliberation I am not Lady Catherine seemed pleased	5.0608719869196825
And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement I will make no promise of the kind Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished	61.05402296585327
I shall not go away till you have given me the assurance I require And I certainly shall give it	240.40991835099712
I am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable	2692.4140429705635
Your ladyship wants Mr Darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wished for promise make marriage at all more probable	100.00000000000001
Supposing him to be attached to me would refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin	149.24955450518294
Allow me to say Lady Catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill judged	61.05402296585327
How far your nephew might approve of your interference in affairs I cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine	83.76776400682921
I must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject Not so hasty if you please	428.1332398719392
I have by no means done	432.40743041354233
To all the objections I have already urged I have still another to add	2154.4346900318833
I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous elopement	3727.5937203149383
I know it all that the young mans marrying her was a patched up business at the expence of your father and uncles	121.15276586285881
And is a girl to be my nephews sister	2390.6215493862082
Is husband is the son of his late fathers steward to be his brother	2154.4346900318833
Heaven and earth of what are you thinking	1622.5957823643093
I must beg to return to the house And she rose as she spoke	2154.4346900318833
Lady Catherine rose also and they turned back	1760.060344050462
Her ladyship was highly incensed	289.3073146308603
You have no regard then for the honour and credit of my nephew	3727.5937203149383
Unfeeling selfish girl	19.280007499081826
Do you not consider that a connection with you must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody Lady Catherine I have nothing farther to say	83.76776400682921
You know my sentiments You are then resolved to have him I have said no such thing	599.4842503189408
I am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to or to any person so wholly unconnected with me It is well	29.552092352028872
You refuse then to oblige me	627.2367209905697
You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world Neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied Elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance	17.782794100389232
No principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr Darcy	3727.5937203149383
And with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moments concern and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn And this is your real opinion	8.778013135972484
Very well	1.284857555844875
I shall now know how to act	962.7998464150356
Do not imagine Miss Bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified	4565.566962304826
I came to try you	264.0029742293326
I send no compliments to your mother	976.9214157645
You deserve no such attention	289.3073146308603
I am most seriously displeased Elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself	71.09709432312432
She heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs	4341.218347705809
Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing room to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself	83.76776400682921
She did not choose it said her daughter she would go She is a very fine looking woman	428.1332398719392
and her calling here was prodigiously civil	1120.6900652727268
for she only came I suppose to tell us the Collinses were well	3727.5937203149383
She is on her road somewhere I dare say and so passing through Meryton thought she might as well call on you	149.24955450518294
I suppose she had nothing particular to say to you Lizzy Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible	36.51741272548377
CHAPTER XV	1.284857555844875
The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly	41.011270705513006
Lady Catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr Darcy	61.05402296585327
It was a rational scheme to be sure	1183.2183902606002
but from what the report of their engagement could originate Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that being the intimate friend of Bingley and being the sister of Jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made every body eager for another to supply the idea	8.11130830789687
And her neighbours at Lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the Collinses the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine had only set down as almost certain and immediate which had looked forward to as possible at some future time	14.547578108480476
In revolving lady Catherines expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference	100.00000000000001
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce	12.216773489967919
If he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him	12.216773489967919
In that case he would return no more	1634.5799516636096
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way	121.15276586285881
I shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy	4913.599025871819
If he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand I shall soon cease to regret him at all The surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs Bennets curiosity and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject	4.948168092155143
The next morning as she was going down stairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand	61.05402296585327
Lizzy said he I was going to look for you come into my room She followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held	11.583232862547103
It suddenly struck her that it might be from lady Catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations	240.40991835099712
She followed her father to the fire place and they both sat down	3727.5937203149383
He then said I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly	1333.521432163324
As it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents	3901.6510155620135
I did not know before that I had daughters on the brink of matrimony	2154.4346900318833
Young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but I think I may defy even sagacity to discover the name of your admirer	83.76776400682921
This letter is from Mr Collins From Mr Collins	2347.3383439049167
and what can have to say Something very much to the purpose of course	2154.4346900318833
Having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs Collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority	19.14481976169958
Your daughter Elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of Bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land Can you possibly guess Lizzy who is meant by this This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire splendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage	4.142704447847673
But now it comes out My motive for cautioning you is as follows	3727.5937203149383
We have reason to imagine that his aunt lady Catherine de Bourgh does not look on the match with a friendly eye	149.24955450518294
you see is the man	289.3073146308603
Now Lizzy I think I surprised you	953.6168117627972
Mr Darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at in his life	149.24955450518294
It is admirable Elizabeth tried to join in her fathers pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile	316.227766016838
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her	2154.4346900318833
Are you not diverted Oh	289.3073146308603
I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned Mr Collins moreover adds I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydias sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known	4.142704447847673
I must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married	29.552092352028872
It was an encouragement of vice and had I been the rector of Longbourn I should very strenuously have opposed it	187.38174228603845
You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing is his notion of christian forgiveness	29.552092352028872
The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlottes situation and his expectation of a young olive branch	240.40991835099712
But Lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it	3186.5133448844886
You are not going to be I hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report	599.4842503189408
For what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn Oh cried Elizabeth I am excessively diverted	71.09709432312432
But it is so strange Yes is what makes it amusing	3855.1198616873567
Had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but perfect indifference and pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd	121.15276586285881
Much as I abominate writing I would not give up Mr Collinss correspondence for any consideration	873.3261623828432
Nay when I read a letter of his I cannot help giving him the preference even over Wickham much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my son in law	36.51741272548377
Did she call to refuse her consent To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it	24.484367468222267
It was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried	3923.2437364294296
Her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of Mr Darcys indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too she might have fancied too	14.547578108480476
CHAPTER XVI	1.284857555844875
Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as Elizabeth half expected Mr Bingley to do he was able to bring Darcy with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherines visit	19.14481976169958
The gentlemen arrived early and before Mrs Bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread Bingley who wanted to be alone with Jane proposed their all walking out	16.57723885589317
It was agreed to	87.7319564626089
Mrs Bennet was not in the habit of walking Mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together	187.38174228603845
Bingley and Jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them	3898.2577209869237
They lagged behind while Elizabeth Kitty and Darcy were to entertain each other	3727.5937203149383
Very little was said by either Kitty was too much afraid of him to talk Elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same	41.011270705513006
They walked towards the Lucases because Kitty wished to call upon Maria and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone	24.484367468222267
Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said Mr Darcy I am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much I may be wounding yours	11.006941712522094
I can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister	1333.521432163324
Ever since I have known it I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it	240.40991835099712
Were it known to the rest of my family I should not have merely my own gratitude to express I am sorry exceedingly sorry replied Darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness	9.55855309468529
I did not think Mrs Gardiner was so little to be trusted You must not blame my aunt	428.1332398719392
Lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course I could not rest till I knew the particulars	71.09709432312432
Let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them If you thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone	10.0
That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on I shall not attempt to deny	83.76776400682921
But your owe me nothing	289.3073146308603
Much as I respect them I believe I thought only of Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word	240.40991835099712
If your feelings are still what they were last April tell me so at once	1333.521432163324
affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances	4.641588833612779
The happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do	19.14481976169958
They walked on without knowing in what direction	1760.060344050462
There was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects	599.4842503189408
She soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who call on him in her return through London and there relate her journey to Longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with Elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyships apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which had refused to give	3.75588809068008
But unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise	4341.218347705809
It taught me to hope said he as I had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before	599.4842503189408
I knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied Yes you know enough of my to believe me capable of	11.006941712522094
For though your accusations were ill founded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof	121.15276586285881
It was unpardonable	19.280007499081826
I cannot think of it without abhorrence We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said Elizabeth	121.15276586285881
The conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both I hope improved in civility I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself	46.415888336127786
The recollection of what I then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me	41.011270705513006
Your reproof so well applied I shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentleman like manner	428.1332398719392
Those were your words	97.91709669801119
You know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured me though it was some time I confess before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression	14.547578108480476
I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way I can easily believe it	240.40991835099712
The turn of your countenance I shall never forget as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me Oh	36.51741272548377
do not repeat what I then said	976.9214157645
These recollections will not do at all	994.5804157604407
I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it Darcy mentioned his letter	599.4842503189408
Did it said he did it make you think better of me	4515.510500015882
Did you on reading it give any credit to its contents She explained what its effect on her had been and how gradually all her former prejudices had been removed	41.011270705513006
I hope you have destroyed the letter	882.6087625441962
There was one part especially the opening of it which I should dread your having the power of reading again	240.40991835099712
I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me The letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not I hope quite so easily changed as that implies When I wrote that letter replied Darcy I believed myself perfectly calm and cool but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit The letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so	3.317671127842857
But think no more of the letter	747.3450409494226
The feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten	29.552092352028872
You must learn some of my philosophy	1120.6900652727268
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of ignorance	83.76776400682921
But with it is not so	416.5290517384577
Painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled	3972.690029577154
As a child I was taught what was but I was not taught to correct my temper	599.4842503189408
I was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit	2154.4346900318833
Unfortunately an only son for many years an only I was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own	4.840960141478948
Such I was from eight to eight and twenty and such I might still have been but for you dearest loveliest Elizabeth	149.24955450518294
What do I not owe you	627.2367209905697
You taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous	5125.616880269244
By you I was properly humbled	564.9677109337
You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased Had you then persuaded yourself that I should Indeed I had	52.983169062837085
What will you think of my vanity	885.9300820740948
I believed you to be wishing expecting my addresses My manners must have been in fault but not intentionally I assure you	149.24955450518294
I never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong	2154.4346900318833
How you must have hated me after evening Hate you	2911.3422845478685
I was angry perhaps at first but my anger soon began to take a proper direction I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at Pemberley	32.74549162877729
You blamed me for coming No indeed I felt nothing but surprise Your surprise could not be greater than in being noticed by you	100.00000000000001
My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness and I confess that I did not expect to receive than my due My object replied Darcy was to shew you by every civility in my power that I was not so mean as to resent the past and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to	4.948168092155143
How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly tell but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you He then told her of Georgianas delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend	3.317671127842857
She expressed her gratitude again but it was too painful a subject to each to be dwelt on farther	316.227766016838
What could become of Mr Bingley and Jane was a wonder which introduced the discussion of affairs	599.4842503189408
Darcy was delighted with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of it	873.3261623828432
I must ask whether you were surprised said Elizabeth	2525.580331332133
When I went away I felt that it would soon happen That is to say you had given your permission	240.40991835099712
I guessed as much And though he exclaimed at the term she found that it had been pretty much the case	187.38174228603845
On the evening before my going to London said he I made a confession to him which I believe I ought to have made long ago	71.09709432312432
I told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent	316.227766016838
His surprise was great	97.91709669801119
I told him moreover that I believed myself mistaken in supposing as I had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated I felt no doubt of their happiness together Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend	7.53690398089854
I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here and I was convinced of her affection And your assurance of it I suppose carried immediate conviction to him It did	20.691380811147894
Bingley is most unaffectedly modest	289.3073146308603
His diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy	100.00000000000001
I was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him	873.3261623828432
I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that I had known it and purposely kept it from him	46.415888336127786
He was angry	19.280007499081826
But his anger I am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sisters sentiments	316.227766016838
He has heartily forgiven me now Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr Bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself	36.51741272548377
She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at and it was rather too early to begin	240.40991835099712
In anticipating the happiness of Bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house	71.09709432312432
In the hall they parted	289.3073146308603
CHAPTER XVII	1.284857555844875
My dear Lizzy where can you have been walking to was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room and from all the others when they sat down to table	22.456979955397745
She had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge	316.227766016838
The evening passed quietly unmarked by any thing extraordinary	2362.9358734847483
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent	3228.4752973329614
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and Elizabeth agitated and confused rather that she was happy than herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her	19.14481976169958
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but Jane and even feared that with the others it was a which not all his fortune and consequence might do away	12.91549665014884
At night she opened her heart to Jane	1760.060344050462
Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennets general habits she was absolutely incredulous here	1333.521432163324
You are joking Lizzy	97.91709669801119
This cannot be engaged to Mr Darcy	832.339589920242
No no you shall not deceive me	1046.3393929311092
I know it to be impossible This is a wretched beginning indeed	3731.8438042853845
Yet indeed I am in earnest	473.0939610736714
I speak nothing but the truth	579.9085843097012
He still loves me and we are engaged Jane looked at her doubtingly	3727.5937203149383
Oh Lizzy	1.284857555844875
it cannot be	15.185040728404084
I know how much you dislike him You know nothing of the matter	3727.5937203149383
is all to be forgot	289.3073146308603
Perhaps I did not always love him so well as I do now	3727.5937203149383
But in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable	4147.021935625597
This is the last time I shall ever remember it myself Miss Bennet still looked all amazement	599.4842503189408
Elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth	3038.8994495021866
Good Heaven	1.284857555844875
can it be really so	258.92699382537717
My dear dear Lizzy I would I do congratulate you but are you certain	2154.4346900318833
forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him There can be no doubt of that	187.38174228603845
It is settled between us already that we are to be the happiest couple in the world	599.4842503189408
But are you pleased Jane	289.3073146308603
Shall you like to have such a brother Very very much	3961.512542590339
Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more delight	2525.580331332133
But we considered it we talked of it as impossible	2815.849380749816
And do you really love him quite well enough	2221.9042328698197
Oh Lizzy	1.284857555844875
do any thing rather than marry without affection	1428.184717578283
I am afraid you will be angry My dearest sister now be serious	3727.5937203149383
I want to talk very seriously	547.2418975491341
Let me know every thing that I am to know without delay	3895.5866987122768
Will you tell me how long you have loved him It has been coming on so gradually that I hardly know when it began	100.00000000000001
But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley Another intreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment	17.782794100389232
When convinced on that article Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish	4826.327613782089
Now I am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself	1333.521432163324
I always had a value for him	1046.3393929311092
Were it for nothing but his love of you I must always have esteemed him but now as Bingleys friend and your husband there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me	26.826957952797255
How little did you tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton	3727.5937203149383
I owe all that I know of it to another not to you Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy	187.38174228603845
She had been unwilling to mention Bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend	83.76776400682921
I had no notion but he would go a shooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company	187.38174228603845
What shall we do with him	627.2367209905697
Lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in Bingleys way Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet	15.505157798326243
As soon as they entered Bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud Mr Bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to day I advise Mr Darcy and Lizzy and Kitty said Mrs Bennet to walk to Oakham Mount this morning	5.4361836201538365
It is a nice long walk and Mr Darcy has never seen the view It may do very well for the others replied Mr Bingley but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty	22.456979955397745
Wont it Kitty Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home	4195.309107406374
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount and Elizabeth silently consented	873.3261623828432
As she went up stairs to get ready Mrs Bennet followed her saying I am quite sorry Lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself	36.51741272548377
But I hope you will not mind it it is all for Janes sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then	41.011270705513006
So do not put yourself to inconvenience During their walk it was resolved that Mr Bennets consent should be asked in the course of the evening	71.09709432312432
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mothers	2390.6215493862082
In the evening soon after Mr Bennet withdrew to the library she saw Mr Darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme	52.983169062837085
She did not fear her fathers opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till Mr Darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile	4.840960141478948
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper Go to your father he wants you in the library She was gone directly	17.782794100389232
Her father was walking about the room looking grave and anxious	3735.5831206719067
Lizzy said he what are you doing	941.0595171310952
Are you out of your senses to be accepting this man	4341.218347705809
It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to Mr Darcy	26.826957952797255
Or in other words you are determined to have him	2890.9074477977106
He is rich to be sure and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane	428.1332398719392
We all know him to be a proud unpleasant sort of man but this would be nothing if you really liked him I do I do like him she replied with tears in her eyes I love him	19.14481976169958
Indeed he has no improper pride	627.2367209905697
He is perfectly amiable	78.60625410999789
You do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms Lizzy said her father I have given him my consent	36.51741272548377
He is the kind of man indeed to whom I should never dare refuse any thing which he condescended to ask	187.38174228603845
I now give it to if you are resolved on having him	4898.878950229736
But let me advise you to think better of it	2779.399917586941
I know your disposition Lizzy	289.3073146308603
I know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior	83.76776400682921
Your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage	2154.4346900318833
You could scarcely escape discredit and misery	1120.6900652727268
My child let me not have the grief of seeing unable to respect your partner in life	599.4842503189408
You know not what you are about Elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that Mr Darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her fathers incredulity and reconcile him to the match	3.5938136638046276
If this be the case he deserves you	1526.5461786045162
I could not have parted with you my Lizzy to any one less worthy To complete the favourable impression she then told him what Mr Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia	36.51741272548377
And so Darcy did every thing made up the match gave the money paid the fellows debts and got him his commission	149.24955450518294
It will save me a world of trouble and economy	3393.7481503500094
Had it been your uncles doing I must and have paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way	121.15276586285881
Every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer any thing material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time	26.826957952797255
When her mother went up to her dressing room at night she followed her and made the important communication	316.227766016838
Its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it Mrs Bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable	187.38174228603845
Nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them	14.547578108480476
Lord bless me	19.280007499081826
only think	1.284857555844875
dear me	1.284857555844875
Oh	1.2848575558448747
how rich and how great you will be	1423.4244250776433
What pin money what jewels what carriages you will have	3194.4674919357367
I am so pleased so happy	547.2418975491341
pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before	3228.4752973329614
I hope he will overlook it	536.151591419881
Dear dear Lizzy	19.280007499081826
A house in town	87.7319564626089
Oh Lord	1.284857555844875
What will become of me	289.3073146308603
But before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her	1333.521432163324
My dearest child she cried I can think of nothing else	3495.212815737095
Ten thousand a year and very likely more	1092.89130320496
And a special licence	87.7319564626089
You must and shall be married by a special licence	3071.2511016511903
But my dearest love tell me what dish Mr Darcy is particularly fond of that I may have it to morrow This was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and Elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for	5.878016072274914
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected for Mrs Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion	9.55855309468529
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and Mr Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem	41.011270705513006
I admire all my three sons in law highly said he	4341.218347705809
Wickham perhaps is my favourite but I think I shall like husband quite as well as Janes CHAPTER XVIII	316.227766016838
Elizabeths spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted Mr Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her	149.24955450518294
I can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place I cannot fix on the hour or the spot or the look or the words which laid the foundation	13.68874509537081
It is too long ago	289.3073146308603
It was very little less	233.6861625136001
The fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention	2154.4346900318833
You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for approbation alone	599.4842503189408
I roused and interested you because I was so unlike	3175.2922756799617
To be sure you knew no actual good of me but nobody thinks of when they fall in love Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while she was ill at Netherfield Dearest Jane	20.691380811147894
who could have done less for her	1046.3393929311092
But make a virtue of it by all means	2236.6682813018356
My good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teazing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and I shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last	7.038135554931555
What made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here	1333.521432163324
Why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me Because you were grave and silent and gave me no encouragement But I was embarrassed And so was I You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner A man who had felt less might How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it	4.460162165376301
But I wonder how long you have gone on if you had been left to yourself	873.3261623828432
I wonder when you have spoken if I had not asked you	3950.668163506362
My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect	2154.4346900318833
This will never do You need not distress yourself	2347.3383439049167
The moral will be perfectly fair	627.2367209905697
I am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude	873.3261623828432
I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours	3727.5937203149383
But tell me what did you come down to Netherfield for	3923.2437364294296
or had you intended any more serious consequence My real purpose was to see and to judge if I could whether I might ever hope to make you love me	41.011270705513006
My avowed one or what I avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which I have since made Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to befall her I am more likely to want time than courage Elizabeth	6.601948484081891
But it ought to be done and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done directly And if I had not a letter to write myself I might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did	10.0
You supposed more than really existed	627.2367209905697
But suppose as much as you chuse give a loose to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err	22.456979955397745
You must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last	316.227766016838
How could I be so silly as to wish it	2890.9074477977106
Your idea of the ponies is delightful	1022.712713897267
We will go round the Park every day	1655.8735216287728
I am the happiest creature in the world	976.5579063737408
Perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such justice	3727.5937203149383
I am happier even than Jane she only smiles I laugh	4341.218347705809
Mr Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me	873.3261623828432
You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas	1962.3297137409525
Yours c Mr Darcys letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style and still different from either was what Mr Bennet sent to Mr Collins in reply to his last	36.51741272548377
DEAR SIR I must trouble you once more for congratulations	3228.475297332962
Console Lady Catherine as well as you can	1205.0174759471806
But if I were you I would stand by the nephew	3335.7311373698167
He has more to give	289.3073146308603
Yours sincerely c Miss Bingleys congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere	240.40991835099712
She wrote even to Jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard	240.40991835099712
Jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved	46.415888336127786
The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brothers in sending it	316.227766016838
Four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister	149.24955450518294
Before any answer could arrive from Mr Collins or any congratulations to Elizabeth from his wife the Longbourn family heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge	46.415888336127786
The reason of this sudden removal was soon evident	2390.6215493862082
At such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw Mr Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband	11.583232862547103
He bore it however with admirable calmness	976.9214157645
He could even listen to Sir William Lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at St	32.74549162877729
If he did shrug his shoulders it was not till Sir William was out of sight	873.3261623828432
Mrs Philipss vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though Mrs Philips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingleys good humour encouraged yet whenever she speak she must be vulgar	11.006941712522094
Elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at Pemberley	3.2769055017089728
Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs Bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters	187.38174228603845
With what delighted pride she afterwards visited Mrs Bingley and talked of Mrs Darcy may be guessed	599.4842503189408
I wish I could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable well informed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly	4.3754793750741845
He delighted in going to Pemberley especially when he was least expected	5079.894397423908
Mr Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth	2503.8526930184926
The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire and Jane and Elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other	19.14481976169958
Kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters	599.4842503189408
In society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great	2154.4346900318833
From the farther disadvantage of Lydias society she was of course carefully kept and though Mrs Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going	14.547578108480476
As for Wickham and Lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters	873.3261623828432
The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished	46.415888336127786
If you love Mr Darcy half as well as I do my dear Wickham you must be very happy	316.227766016838
It is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do I hope you will think of us	83.76776400682921
I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very much and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help	46.415888336127786
Any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to Mr Darcy about it if you had rather not	61.05402296585327
Yours c As it happened that Elizabeth had rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind	61.05402296585327
They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought	187.38174228603845
His affection for her soon sunk into indifference hers lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her	24.484367468222267
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath and with the Bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even Bingleys good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to of giving them a hint to be gone	8.778013135972484
Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcys marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of Georgiana almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth	9.55855309468529
Pemberley was now Georgianas home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see	316.227766016838
Georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother	32.74549162877729
Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way	4826.327613782089
By Elizabeths instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself	29.552092352028872
Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of Elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end	8.11130830789687
But at length by Elizabeths persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at Pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city	3.5938136638046276
Darcy as well as Elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into Derbyshire had been the means of uniting them	26.826957952797255
