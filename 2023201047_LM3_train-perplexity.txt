Title Ulysses Author James Joyce Release Date December eBook Most recently updated December Language English Character set encoding UTF Produced by Col Choat and David Widger START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ULYSSES Illustration Ulysses by James Joyce Contents I II III I Stately plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed	5.722367659350217
A yellow dressinggown ungirdled was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air	2154.4346900318833
He held the bowl aloft and intoned ad altare	4026.008396445538
Halted he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely Come up Kinch	1333.521432163324
Come up you fearful jesuit	410.6204064167453
Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest	4014.671278934556
He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower the surrounding land and the awaking mountains	873.3261623828432
Then catching sight of Stephen Dedalus he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air gurgling in his throat and shaking his head	83.76776400682921
Stephen Dedalus displeased and sleepy leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him equine in its length and at the light untonsured hair grained and hued like pale oak	15.505157798326243
Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly	2154.4346900318833
he said sternly	21.840993118326033
He added in a preacher s tone For this O dearly beloved is the genuine Christine body and soul and blood and ouns	121.15276586285881
Slow music please	21.840993118326033
Shut your eyes gents	111.6792609014905
A little trouble about those white corpuscles	1780.428763062773
Silence all	1.1617274079423625
He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call then paused awhile in rapt attention his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points	46.415888336127786
Chrysostomos	1.1617274079423625
Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm	2903.2601932065677
Thanks old chap he cried briskly	862.742811655988
That will do nicely	104.22607962703682
Switch off the current will you	949.4860105710369
He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown	187.38174228603845
The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate patron of arts in the middle ages	428.1332398719392
A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips	2694.78913506113
The mockery of it	98.21363663353286
he said gaily	21.840993118326033
Your absurd name an ancient Greek	949.4860105710369
He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet laughing to himself	873.3261623828432
Stephen Dedalus stepped up followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck	17.782794100389232
Buck Mulligan s gay voice went on	1462.1519118532806
My name is absurd too Malachi Mulligan two dactyls	4014.671278934556
But it has a Hellenic ring hasn t it	4293.13994636419
Tripping and sunny like the buck himself	1780.428763062773
We must go to Athens	410.6204064167453
Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid	2154.4346900318833
He laid the brush aside and laughing with delight cried Will he come	3727.5937203149383
The jejune jesuit	21.840993118326033
Ceasing he began to shave with care	1637.2623817614965
Tell me Mulligan Stephen said quietly	862.742811655988
Yes my love	21.840993118326033
How long is Haines going to stay in this tower	5912.555183224002
Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder	5233.841450267788
God isn t he dreadful	410.6204064167453
he said frankly	21.840993118326033
A ponderous Saxon	21.840993118326033
He thinks you re not a gentleman	1262.7785984861998
God these bloody English	126.99109556487812
Bursting with money and indigestion	367.1967010491309
Because he comes from Oxford	410.6204064167453
He can t make you out	787.0887026711796
O my name for you is the best Kinch the knife blade	7017.038286703832
He shaved warily over his chin	949.4860105710369
He was raving all night about a black panther Stephen said	7300.251061821653
Where is his guncase	126.99109556487812
A woful lunatic	21.840993118326033
Mulligan said	1.1617274079423625
Were you in a funk	328.36511569890223
I was Stephen said with energy and growing fear	3889.346285241056
Out here in the dark with a man I don t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther	149.24955450518294
You saved men from drowning	328.36511569890223
I m not a hero however	615.5936319815679
If he stays on here I am off	2694.78913506113
Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade	3754.265101828748
Scutter	1.1617274079423625
he cried thickly	21.840993118326033
He came over to the gunrest and thrusting a hand into Stephen s upper pocket said Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor	61.05402296585327
Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief	428.1332398719392
Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly	862.742811655988
Then gazing over the handkerchief he said The bard s noserag	6054.043173546456
A new art colour for our Irish poets snotgreen	4293.13994636419
You can almost taste it can t you	2903.2601932065677
He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly	428.1332398719392
God	1.1617274079423625
he said quietly	18.469695921350887
Isn t the sea what Algy calls it a great sweet mother	7017.038286703832
The snotgreen sea	21.840993118326033
The scrotumtightening sea	21.840993118326033
oinopa	1.1617274079423625
Ah Dedalus the Greeks	126.99109556487812
You must read them in the original	1371.280387434486
	1.1617274079423625
Thalatta She is our great sweet mother	1618.137084703284
Come and look	21.840993118326033
Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet	2452.4442465305365
Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown	428.1332398719392
Our mighty mother	21.840993118326033
Buck Mulligan said	11.526991910222874
He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen s face	2154.4346900318833
The aunt thinks you killed your mother he said	3070.0805659847647
That s why she won t let me have anything to do with you	2154.4346900318833
Someone killed her Stephen said gloomily	949.4860105710369
You could have knelt down damn it Kinch when your dying mother asked you Buck Mulligan said	599.4842503189408
I m hyperborean as much as you	1425.931701770153
But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her	316.227766016838
And you refused	21.840993118326033
There is something sinister in you	949.4860105710369
He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek	5562.856855515288
But a lovely mummer	126.99109556487812
he murmured to himself	126.99109556487812
Kinch the loveliest mummer of them all	1462.1519118532806
He shaved evenly and with care in silence seriously	4014.671278934556
Stephen an elbow rested on the jagged granite leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat sleeve	71.09709432312432
Pain that was not yet the pain of love fretted his heart	7017.038286703832
Silently in a dream she had come to him after her death her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath that had bent upon him mute reproachful a faint odour of wetted ashes	13.68874509537081
Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him	240.40991835099712
The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid	3727.5937203149383
Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade	862.742811655988
Ah poor dogsbody	18.469695921350887
he said in a kind voice	610.80692016425
I must give you a shirt and a few noserags	5085.097784126136
How are the secondhand breeks	367.1967010491309
They fit well enough Stephen answered	949.4860105710369
Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip	2903.2601932065677
The mockery of it he said contentedly	1181.6213063555147
Secondleg they should be	126.99109556487812
God knows what poxy bowsy left them off	2694.78913506113
I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe grey	5123.53892068312
You ll look spiffing in them	949.4860105710369
I m not joking Kinch	281.3364839629534
You look damn well when you re dressed	2666.78996584088
Thanks Stephen said	21.840993118326033
I can t wear them if they are grey	2947.703962332767
He can t wear them Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror	3727.5937203149383
Etiquette is etiquette	21.840993118326033
He kills his mother but he can t wear grey trousers	6935.983627761107
He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin	1333.521432163324
Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes	599.4842503189408
That fellow I was with in the Ship last night said Buck Mulligan says you have g	599.4842503189408
p	1.1617274079423625
i	1.1617274079423625
He s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman	2694.78913506113
General paralysis of the insane	410.6204064167453
He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea	149.24955450518294
His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth	3727.5937203149383
Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk	1780.428763062773
Look at yourself he said you dreadful bard	2694.78913506113
Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him cleft by a crooked crack	599.4842503189408
Hair on end	21.840993118326033
As he and others see me	862.742811655988
Who chose this face for me	949.4860105710369
This dogsbody to rid of vermin	949.4860105710369
It asks me too	126.99109556487812
I pinched it out of the skivvy s room Buck Mulligan said	5094.963339278119
It does her all right	410.6204064167453
The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi	2903.2601932065677
Lead him not into temptation	410.6204064167453
And her name is Ursula	367.1967010491309
Laughing again he brought the mirror away from Stephen s peering eyes	7017.038286703832
The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror he said	2154.4346900318833
If Wilde were only alive to see you	2549.312743403261
Drawing back and pointing Stephen said with bitterness It is a symbol of Irish art	1333.521432163324
The cracked lookingglass of a servant	705.6421096520047
Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen s and walked with him round the tower his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them	46.415888336127786
It s not fair to tease you like that Kinch is it	7017.038286703832
he said kindly	18.469695921350887
God knows you have more spirit than any of them	5562.856855515288
Parried again	1.1617274079423625
He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his	3727.5937203149383
The cold steel pen	126.99109556487812
Cracked lookingglass of a servant	324.78367536802114
Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea	3727.5937203149383
He s stinking with money and thinks you re not a gentleman	7017.038286703832
His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other	599.4842503189408
God Kinch if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island	599.4842503189408
Hellenise it	1.1617274079423625
Cranly s arm	18.469695921350887
His arm	1.1617274079423625
And to think of your having to beg from these swine	6054.043173546456
I m the only one that knows what you are	4944.567294914862
Why don t you trust me more	1147.0519984734613
Is it Haines	21.840993118326033
If he makes any noise here I ll bring down Seymour and we ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe	100.00000000000001
Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe s rooms	5912.555183224002
Palefaces they hold their ribs with laughter one clasping another	5912.555183224002
O I shall expire	126.99109556487812
Break the news to her gently Aubrey	1780.428763062773
I shall die	21.840993118326033
With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table with trousers down at heels chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor s shears	36.51741272548377
A scared calf s face gilded with marmalade	2903.2601932065677
I don t want to be debagged	695.4758175336075
Don t you play the giddy ox with me	3516.727793497145
A deaf gardener aproned masked with Matthew Arnold s face pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms	100.00000000000001
To ourselves	1.1617274079423625
new paganism	1.1617274079423625
omphalos	1.1617274079423625
Let him stay Stephen said	410.6204064167453
There s nothing wrong with him except at night	3764.8668526744877
Then what is it	100.49400469796984
Buck Mulligan asked impatiently	108.9829112695572
Cough it up	18.469695921350887
I m quite frank with you	949.4860105710369
What have you against me now	851.2348218321658
They halted looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale	149.24955450518294
Stephen freed his arm quietly	410.6204064167453
Do you wish me to tell you	1538.1684667290513
he asked	1.1617274079423625
Yes what is it	100.49400469796984
Buck Mulligan answered	18.040717293319346
I don t remember anything	193.8410907035452
A light wind passed his brow fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes	187.38174228603845
Stephen depressed by his own voice said Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother s death	121.15276586285881
Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said What	1637.2623817614965
Where	1.1617274079423625
I can t remember anything	273.1058069204301
I remember only ideas and sensations	949.4860105710369
Why	1.1617274079423625
What happened in the name of God	1122.9548123775965
You were making tea Stephen said and went across the landing to get more hot water	873.3261623828432
Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom	3789.8614269267746
She asked you who was in your room	2703.245875619065
Yes	1.1617274079423625
Buck Mulligan said	11.526991910222874
What did I say	111.05117566129712
I forget	1.1617274079423625
You said Stephen answered it s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly dead A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan s cheek	46.415888336127786
Did I say that	111.05117566129712
he asked	1.1617274079423625
Well	1.1617274079423625
What harm is that	126.99109556487812
He shook his constraint from him nervously	1780.428763062773
And what is death he asked your mother s or yours or my own	2154.4346900318833
I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom	240.40991835099712
It s a beastly thing and nothing else	2320.260824574836
It simply doesn t matter	410.6204064167453
You wouldn t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you	599.4842503189408
Why	1.1617274079423625
Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you only it s injected the wrong way	873.3261623828432
To me it s all a mockery and beastly	3637.0691429269077
Her cerebral lobes are not functioning	949.4860105710369
She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt	3727.5937203149383
Humour her till it s over	949.4860105710369
You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don t whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette s	83.76776400682921
Absurd	1.1617274079423625
I suppose I did say it	851.2348218321658
I didn t mean to offend the memory of your mother	4988.393195695536
He had spoken himself into boldness	949.4860105710369
Stephen shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart said very coldly I am not thinking of the offence to my mother	71.09709432312432
Of what then	21.840993118326033
Buck Mulligan asked	18.040717293319346
Of the offence to me Stephen answered	1505.608178403045
Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel	1780.428763062773
he exclaimed	1.1617274079423625
He walked off quickly round the parapet	1780.428763062773
Stephen stood at his post gazing over the calm sea towards the headland	3727.5937203149383
Sea and headland now grew dim	949.4860105710369
Pulses were beating in his eyes veiling their sight and he felt the fever of his cheeks	599.4842503189408
A voice within the tower called loudly Are you up there Mulligan	7017.038286703832
I m coming Buck Mulligan answered	776.5898510338078
He turned towards Stephen and said Look at the sea	4312.592916579697
What does it care about offences	949.4860105710369
Chuck Loyola Kinch and come on down	1780.428763062773
The Sassenach wants his morning rashers	949.4860105710369
His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase level with the roof Don t mope over it all day he said	71.09709432312432
I m inconsequent	21.840993118326033
Give up the moody brooding	410.6204064167453
His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead And no more turn aside and brood Upon love s bitter mystery For Fergus rules the brazen cars	29.552092352028872
Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed	1333.521432163324
Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened spurned by lightshod hurrying feet	2154.4346900318833
White breast of the dim sea	949.4860105710369
The twining stresses two by two	862.742811655988
A hand plucking the harpstrings merging their twining chords	4293.13994636419
Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide	2903.2601932065677
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly wholly shadowing the bay in deeper green	1333.521432163324
It lay beneath him a bowl of bitter waters	4026.008396445538
Fergus song I sang it alone in the house holding down the long dark chords	1333.521432163324
Her door was open she wanted to hear my music	5515.522139545052
Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside	5315.9187681762505
She was crying in her wretched bed	1780.428763062773
For those words Stephen love s bitter mystery	2509.1370150228763
Where now	1.1617274079423625
Her secrets old featherfans tasselled dancecards powdered with musk a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer	428.1332398719392
A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl	1333.521432163324
She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang I am the boy That can enjoy Invisibility	61.05402296585327
Phantasmal mirth folded away muskperfumed	410.6204064167453
And no more turn aside and brood	1191.6460918030161
Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys	5014.346760775272
Memories beset his brooding brain	410.6204064167453
Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament	2154.4346900318833
A cored apple filled with brown sugar roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening	428.1332398719392
Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children s shirts	1333.521432163324
In a dream silently she had come to him her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath bent over him with mute secret words a faint odour of wetted ashes	17.782794100389232
Her glazing eyes staring out of death to shake and bend my soul	3727.5937203149383
On me alone	21.840993118326033
The ghostcandle to light her agony	949.4860105710369
Ghostly light on the tortured face	866.2253711860347
Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror while all prayed on their knees	3727.5937203149383
Her eyes on me to strike me down	2694.78913506113
rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat Ghoul	7300.251061821653
Chewer of corpses	21.840993118326033
Let me be and let me live	1516.2600004008164
Kinch ahoy	1.1617274079423625
Buck Mulligan s voice sang from within the tower	2998.9843370607377
It came nearer up the staircase calling again	2549.312743403261
Stephen still trembling at his soul s cry heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words	240.40991835099712
Dedalus come down like a good mosey	1493.2751896377315
Breakfast is ready	21.840993118326033
Haines is apologising for waking us last night	2903.2601932065677
It s all right	67.12923214326068
I m coming Stephen said turning	787.0887026711796
For my sake and for all our sakes	2601.4832449920805
His head disappeared and reappeared	410.6204064167453
I told him your symbol of Irish art	2140.6231319340964
He says it s very clever	949.4860105710369
Touch him for a quid will you	1392.387428137384
A guinea I mean	126.99109556487812
I get paid this morning Stephen said	1637.2623817614965
The school kip	21.840993118326033
Buck Mulligan said	11.526991910222874
How much	1.1617274079423625
Four quid	1.1617274079423625
Lend us one	21.840993118326033
If you want it Stephen said	763.1504980930177
Four shining sovereigns Buck Mulligan cried with delight	2601.4832449920805
We ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids	7300.251061821653
He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs singing out of tune with a Cockney accent O won t we have a merry time Drinking whisky beer and wine	32.74549162877729
On coronation Coronation day	126.99109556487812
O won t we have a merry time On coronation day	5144.433553798916
Warm sunshine merrying over the sea	866.2253711860347
The nickel shavingbowl shone forgotten on the parapet	2694.78913506113
Why should I bring it down	862.742811655988
Or leave it there all day forgotten friendship	2903.2601932065677
He went over to it held it in his hands awhile feeling its coolness smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck	61.05402296585327
So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes	5912.555183224002
I am another now and yet the same	2903.2601932065677
A servant too	21.840993118326033
A server of a servant	361.48876812228025
In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth hiding and revealing its yellow glow	61.05402296585327
Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated turning	32.74549162877729
We ll be choked Buck Mulligan said	1293.4403497287617
Haines open that door will you	949.4860105710369
Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker	1637.2623817614965
A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors	149.24955450518294
Have you the key	100.49400469796984
a voice asked	18.469695921350887
Dedalus has it Buck Mulligan said	590.8071297718723
Janey Mack I m choked	410.6204064167453
He howled without looking up from the fire Kinch	3254.1621521828088
It s in the lock Stephen said coming forward	2939.788391955187
The key scraped round harshly twice and when the heavy door had been set ajar welcome light and bright air entered	187.38174228603845
Haines stood at the doorway looking out	1643.043796432458
Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait	3727.5937203149383
Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him	6135.203843089739
Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table set them down heavily and sighed with relief	187.38174228603845
I m melting he said as the candle remarked when	4924.2856751531135
But hush	1.1617274079423625
Not a word more on that subject	1643.043796432458
Kinch wake up	21.840993118326033
Bread butter honey	21.840993118326033
Haines come in	21.840993118326033
The grub is ready	126.99109556487812
Bless us O Lord and these thy gifts	2903.2601932065677
Where s the sugar	94.87513479536454
O jay there s no milk	866.2253711860347
Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker	1333.521432163324
Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet	2000.2307541757693
What sort of a kip is this	1425.931701770153
he said	1.1617274079423625
We can drink it black Stephen said thirstily	2903.2601932065677
There s a lemon in the locker	1307.5851358569478
O damn you and your Paris fads	1780.428763062773
Buck Mulligan said	11.526991910222874
I want Sandycove milk	126.99109556487812
Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly That woman is coming up with the milk	599.4842503189408
The blessings of God on you	949.4860105710369
Buck Mulligan cried jumping up from his chair	2414.6815363129367
Sit down	1.1617274079423625
Pour out the tea there	367.1967010491309
The sugar is in the bag	714.0398318352517
Here I can t go fumbling at the damned eggs	4733.36476959592
He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates saying nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti Haines sat down to pour out the tea	36.51741272548377
I m giving you two lumps each he said	4293.13994636419
But I say Mulligan you do make strong tea don t you	7017.038286703832
Buck Mulligan hewing thick slices from the loaf said in an old woman s wheedling voice When I makes tea I makes tea as old mother Grogan said	52.983169062837085
And when I makes water I makes water	2321.680448289125
By Jove it is tea Haines said	1780.428763062773
Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling I do Mrs Cahill says she	3727.5937203149383
ma am says Mrs Cahill send you don t make them in the one pot He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread impaled on his knife	36.51741272548377
That s folk he said very earnestly for your book Haines	7317.42647154861
Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum	599.4842503189408
Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind	7017.038286703832
He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice lifting his brows Can you recall brother is mother Grogan s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads	20.691380811147894
Do you now	21.840993118326033
Buck Mulligan said in the same tone	776.5829316034192
Your reasons pray	21.840993118326033
I fancy Stephen said as he ate it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion	599.4842503189408
Mother Grogan was one imagines a kinswoman of Mary Ann	5562.856855515288
Buck Mulligan s face smiled with delight	1462.1519118532806
Charming	1.1617274079423625
he said in a finical sweet voice showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly	873.3261623828432
Do you think she was	337.8673804303916
Quite charming	1.1617274079423625
Then suddenly overclouding all his features he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf For old Mary Ann She doesn t care a damn	36.51741272548377
But hising up her petticoats He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned	1333.521432163324
The milk sir	21.840993118326033
Come in ma am Mulligan said	949.4860105710369
Kinch get the jug	126.99109556487812
An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen s elbow	6528.238891300286
That s a lovely morning sir she said	2158.282699435851
Glory be to God	87.8799991367897
To whom	1.1617274079423625
Mulligan said glancing at her	367.1967010491309
Ah to be sure	97.44303345634985
Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker	5562.856855515288
The islanders Mulligan said to Haines casually speak frequently of the collector of prepuces	2154.4346900318833
How much sir	21.840993118326033
asked the old woman	97.44303345634985
A quart Stephen said	126.99109556487812
He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk not hers	599.4842503189408
Old shrunken paps	21.840993118326033
She poured again a measureful and a tilly	2903.2601932065677
Old and secret she had entered from a morning world maybe a messenger	3727.5937203149383
She praised the goodness of the milk pouring it out	5912.555183224002
Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field a witch on her toadstool her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs	100.00000000000001
They lowed about her whom they knew dewsilky cattle	4293.13994636419
Silk of the kine and poor old woman names given her in old times	2154.4346900318833
A wandering crone lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer their common cuckquean a messenger from the secret morning	100.00000000000001
To serve or to upbraid whether he could not tell but scorned to beg her favour	873.3261623828432
It is indeed ma am Buck Mulligan said pouring milk into their cups	3727.5937203149383
Taste it sir she said	348.29171113587296
He drank at her bidding	410.6204064167453
If we could live on good food like that he said to her somewhat loudly we wouldn t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts	52.983169062837085
Living in a bogswamp eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust horsedung and consumptives spits	599.4842503189408
Are you a medical student sir	851.2348218321658
the old woman asked	97.44303345634985
I am ma am Buck Mulligan answered	1368.3672602073264
Look at that now she said	949.4860105710369
Stephen listened in scornful silence	410.6204064167453
She bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly her bonesetter her medicineman me she slights	240.40991835099712
To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman s unclean loins of man s flesh made not in God s likeness the serpent s prey	22.456979955397745
And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes	1333.521432163324
Do you understand what he says	787.0887026711796
Stephen asked her	21.840993118326033
Is it French you are talking sir	1637.2623817614965
the old woman said to Haines	642.736258297858
Haines spoke to her again a longer speech confidently	3754.265101828748
Irish Buck Mulligan said	76.16021387784333
Is there Gaelic on you	410.6204064167453
I thought it was Irish she said by the sound of it	7017.038286703832
Are you from the west sir	862.742811655988
I am an Englishman Haines answered	862.742811655988
He s English Buck Mulligan said and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland	873.3261623828432
I m told it s a grand language by them that knows	7017.038286703832
Grand is no name for it said Buck Mulligan	4026.008396445538
Wonderful entirely	1.1617274079423625
Fill us out some more tea Kinch	1780.428763062773
Would you like a cup ma am	1390.8443077876277
No thank you sir the old woman said slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go	187.38174228603845
Haines said to her Have you your bill	2509.1370150228763
We had better pay her Mulligan hadn t we	4014.671278934556
Stephen filled again the three cups	949.4860105710369
Bill sir	1.1617274079423625
she said halting	21.840993118326033
Well it s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling	32.74549162877729
That s a shilling and one and two is two and two sir	3727.5937203149383
Buck Mulligan sighed and having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets	61.05402296585327
Pay up and look pleasant Haines said to him smiling	4796.620248357602
Stephen filled a third cup a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk	1333.521432163324
Buck Mulligan brought up a florin twisted it round in his fingers and cried A miracle	873.3261623828432
He passed it along the table towards the old woman saying Ask nothing more of me sweet	599.4842503189408
All I can give you I give	1394.335741552161
We ll owe twopence he said	862.742811655988
Time enough sir she said taking the coin	2422.259248059267
Time enough	1.1617274079423625
Good morning sir	18.040717293319346
She curtseyed and went out followed by Buck Mulligan s tender chant Heart of my heart were it more More would be laid at your feet He turned to Stephen and said Seriously Dedalus	26.826957952797255
I m stony	21.840993118326033
Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money	7017.038286703832
Today the bards must drink and junket	1505.608178403045
Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty	7300.251061821653
That reminds me Haines said rising that I have to visit your national library today	1333.521432163324
Our swim first Buck Mulligan said	658.9992447167798
He turned to Stephen and asked blandly Is this the day for your monthly wash Kinch	873.3261623828432
Then he said to Haines The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month	873.3261623828432
All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf	240.40991835099712
Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me	26.826957952797255
Speaking to me	21.840993118326033
They wash and tub and scrub	949.4860105710369
Agenbite of inwit	18.040717293319346
Conscience	1.1617274079423625
Yet here s a spot	367.1967010491309
That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good	428.1332398719392
Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone Wait till you hear him on Hamlet Haines	121.15276586285881
Well I mean it Haines said still speaking to Stephen	5912.555183224002
I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in	3727.5937203149383
Would I make any money by it	1780.428763062773
Stephen asked	1.1617274079423625
Haines laughed and as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock said I don t know I m sure	100.00000000000001
He strolled out to the doorway	668.6181258495413
Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour You put your hoof in it now	428.1332398719392
What did you say that for	787.0887026711796
Well	1.1617274079423625
Stephen said	1.1617274079423625
The problem is to get money	949.4860105710369
From whom	1.1617274079423625
From the milkwoman or from him	862.742811655988
It s a toss up I think	1383.5880605385773
I blow him out about you Buck Mulligan said and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes	121.15276586285881
I see little hope Stephen said from her or from him	6903.461660503397
Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen s arm	7017.038286703832
From me Kinch he said	410.6204064167453
In a suddenly changed tone he added To tell you the God s truth I think you re right	316.227766016838
Damn all else they are good for	1637.2623817614965
Why don t you play them as I do	2469.714122209529
To hell with them all	323.2608049832237
Let us get out of the kip	1007.4112027396161
He stood up gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown saying resignedly Mulligan is stripped of his garments	316.227766016838
He emptied his pockets on to the table	1855.3868928872384
There s your snotrag he said	862.742811655988
And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them chiding them and to his dangling watchchain	240.40991835099712
His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief	1333.521432163324
God we ll simply have to dress the character	4026.008396445538
I want puce gloves and green boots	1505.608178403045
Contradiction	1.1617274079423625
Do I contradict myself	111.05117566129712
Very well then I contradict myself	862.742811655988
Mercurial Malachi	1.1617274079423625
A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands	4686.467498293404
And there s your Latin quarter hat he said	3764.8668526744877
Stephen picked it up and put it on	1899.905904213626
Haines called to them from the doorway Are you coming you fellows	7017.038286703832
I m ready Buck Mulligan answered going towards the door	4840.840070797357
Come out Kinch	21.840993118326033
You have eaten all we left I suppose	2154.9702165079902
Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait saying wellnigh with sorrow And going forth he met Butterly	316.227766016838
Stephen taking his ashplant from its leaningplace followed them out and as they went down the ladder pulled to the slow iron door and locked it	71.09709432312432
He put the huge key in his inner pocket	3754.265101828748
At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked Did you bring the key	2154.4346900318833
I have it Stephen said preceding them	1397.959575902287
He walked on	17.06185700055526
Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses	428.1332398719392
Down sir	1.1617274079423625
How dare you sir	97.11203420129426
Haines asked Do you pay rent for this tower	4293.13994636419
Twelve quid Buck Mulligan said	268.16551756047176
To the secretary of state for war Stephen added over his shoulder	7017.038286703832
They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last Rather bleak in wintertime I should say	428.1332398719392
Martello you call it	104.22607962703682
Billy Pitt had them built Buck Mulligan said when the French were on the sea	1333.521432163324
But ours is the	126.99109556487812
What is your idea of Hamlet	866.2253711860347
Haines asked Stephen	21.840993118326033
I m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up	316.227766016838
Wait till I have a few pints in me first	4345.194250960804
He turned to Stephen saying as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat You couldn t manage it under three pints Kinch could you	61.05402296585327
It has waited so long Stephen said listlessly it can wait longer	7017.038286703832
You pique my curiosity Haines said amiably	1780.428763062773
Is it some paradox	126.99109556487812
Pooh	1.1617274079423625
Buck Mulligan said	11.526991910222874
We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes	2903.2601932065677
It s quite simple	126.99109556487812
He proves by algebra that Hamlet s grandson is Shakespeare s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father	121.15276586285881
What	1.1617274079423625
Haines said beginning to point at Stephen	1780.428763062773
He himself	1.1617274079423625
Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and bending in loose laughter said to Stephen s ear O shade of Kinch the elder	83.76776400682921
Japhet in search of a father	862.742811655988
We re always tired in the morning Stephen said to Haines	5620.106883293303
And it is rather long to tell	1780.428763062773
Buck Mulligan walking forward again raised his hands	2903.2601932065677
The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus he said	7017.038286703832
I mean to say Haines explained to Stephen as they followed this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore	149.24955450518294
beetles o er his base into the sea isn t it	5528.395801322162
Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak	3727.5937203149383
In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires	428.1332398719392
It s a wonderful tale Haines said bringing them to halt again	7017.038286703832
Eyes pale as the sea the wind had freshened paler firm and prudent	3727.5937203149383
The seas ruler he gazed southward over the bay empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins	46.415888336127786
I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere he said bemused	7300.251061821653
The Father and the Son idea	949.4860105710369
The Son striving to be atoned with the Father	4014.671278934556
Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face	7719.846677868277
He looked at them his wellshaped mouth open happily his eyes from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense blinking with mad gaiety	100.00000000000001
He moved a doll s head to and fro the brims of his Panama hat quivering and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice I m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard	22.456979955397745
My mother s a jew my father s a bird	4359.017325149562
With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree	1637.2623817614965
So here s to disciples and Calvary He held up a forefinger of warning	2154.4346900318833
If anyone thinks that I amn t divine He ll get no free drinks when I m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water again He tugged swiftly at Stephen s ashplant in farewell and running forward to a brow of the cliff fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air and chanted Goodbye now goodbye	4.142704447847673
Write down all I said And tell Tom Dick and Harry I rose from the dead	873.3261623828432
What s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly And Olivet s breezy	1333.521432163324
Goodbye now goodbye He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole fluttering his winglike hands leaping nimbly Mercury s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries	24.484367468222267
Haines who had been laughing guardedly walked on beside Stephen and said We oughtn t to laugh I suppose	316.227766016838
He s rather blasphemous	126.99109556487812
I m not a believer myself that is to say	3365.564862604416
Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow doesn t it	3727.5937203149383
What did he call it	348.2917111358729
Joseph the Joiner	21.840993118326033
The ballad of joking Jesus Stephen answered	1780.428763062773
O Haines said you have heard it before	2694.78913506113
Three times a day after meals Stephen said drily	3977.110094220475
You re not a believer are you	1373.1991665905382
Haines asked	1.1617274079423625
I mean a believer in the narrow sense of the word	5795.059723193281
Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God	3754.265101828748
There s only one sense of the word it seems to me Stephen said	2154.4346900318833
Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone	1333.521432163324
He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it	4644.931008380942
Thank you Stephen said taking a cigarette	1780.428763062773
Haines helped himself and snapped the case to	2694.78913506113
He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox sprang it open too and having lit his cigarette held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his hands	22.456979955397745
Yes of course he said as they went on again	3745.1755125452232
Either you believe or you don t isn t it	4363.580154377352
Personally I couldn t stomach that idea of a personal God	6295.842833519821
You don t stand for that I suppose	2140.6231319340964
You behold in me Stephen said with grim displeasure a horrible example of free thought	1333.521432163324
He walked on waiting to be spoken to trailing his ashplant by his side	2154.4346900318833
Its ferrule followed lightly on the path squealing at his heels	6919.703537878488
My familiar after me calling Steeeeeeeeeeeephen	949.4860105710369
A wavering line along the path	949.4860105710369
They will walk on it tonight coming here in the dark	5893.349156862649
It is mine	21.840993118326033
I paid the rent	126.99109556487812
Give him the key too	367.1967010491309
He will ask for it	410.6204064167453
That was in his eyes	224.71738404273097
After all Haines began	126.99109556487812
Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind	873.3261623828432
After all I should think you are able to free yourself	7719.846677868277
You are your own master it seems to me	3729.642833208875
I am a servant of two masters Stephen said an English and an Italian	2154.4346900318833
Italian	1.1617274079423625
Haines said	1.1617274079423625
A crazy queen old and jealous	949.4860105710369
Kneel down before me	126.99109556487812
And a third Stephen said there is who wants me for odd jobs	3727.5937203149383
Italian	1.1617274079423625
Haines said again	21.840993118326033
What do you mean	81.4931607871175
The imperial British state Stephen answered his colour rising and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church	599.4842503189408
Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke	7017.038286703832
I can quite understand that he said calmly	2235.692572699173
An Irishman must think like that I daresay	2601.4832449920805
We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly	6543.597976461058
It seems history is to blame	720.9672854189315
The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen s memory the triumph of their brazen bells unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts a chemistry of stars	17.782794100389232
Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus the voices blended singing alone loud in affirmation and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs	26.826957952797255
A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one and Arius warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father and Valentine spurning Christ s terrene body and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son	7.2789538439831505
Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger	7017.038286703832
Idle mockery	1.1617274079423625
Hear hear	1.1617274079423625
Prolonged applause	1.1617274079423625
	1.1617274079423625
Nom de Dieu Of course I m a Britisher Haines s voice said and I feel as one	428.1332398719392
I don t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either	873.3261623828432
That s our national problem I m afraid just now	5562.856855515288
Two men stood at the verge of the cliff watching businessman boatman	7017.038286703832
She s making for Bullock harbour	949.4860105710369
The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain	7017.038286703832
There s five fathoms out there he said	2694.78913506113
It ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one	2154.4346900318833
It s nine days today	410.6204064167453
The man that was drowned	284.5819358938631
A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up roll over to the sun a puffy face saltwhite	100.00000000000001
Here I am	18.469695921350887
They followed the winding path down to the creek	3628.888399641032
Buck Mulligan stood on a stone in shirtsleeves his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder	1333.521432163324
A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water	100.00000000000001
Is the brother with you Malachi	949.4860105710369
Down in Westmeath	21.840993118326033
With the Bannons	21.840993118326033
I got a card from Bannon	949.4860105710369
Says he found a sweet young thing down there	4293.13994636419
Photo girl he calls her	367.1967010491309
Snapshot eh	1.1617274079423625
Brief exposure	1.1617274079423625
Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots	2297.5579212604866
An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face	2154.4346900318833
He scrambled up by the stones water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth	26.826957952797255
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and glancing at Haines and Stephen crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone	61.05402296585327
Seymour s back in town the young man said grasping again his spur of rock	1333.521432163324
Chucked medicine and going in for the army	2694.78913506113
Ah go to God	126.99109556487812
Buck Mulligan said	11.526991910222874
Going over next week to stew	949.4860105710369
You know that red Carlisle girl Lily	1643.043796432458
Yes	1.1617274079423625
Spooning with him last night on the pier	2501.287517886216
The father is rotto with money	949.4860105710369
Is she up the pole	410.6204064167453
Better ask Seymour that	126.99109556487812
Seymour a bleeding officer	126.99109556487812
Buck Mulligan said	11.526991910222874
He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up saying tritely Redheaded women buck like goats	240.40991835099712
He broke off in alarm feeling his side under his flapping shirt	7017.038286703832
My twelfth rib is gone he cried	1637.2623817614965
I m the Toothless Kinch and I the supermen	3483.8253581386653
He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay	873.3261623828432
Are you going in here Malachi	803.3290774201911
Yes	1.1617274079423625
Make room in the bed	323.2608049832237
The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes	187.38174228603845
Haines sat down on a stone smoking	1282.2155564717673
Are you not coming in	315.78952605321376
Buck Mulligan asked	18.040717293319346
Later on Haines said	126.99109556487812
Not on my breakfast	111.05117566129712
Stephen turned away	21.840993118326033
I m going Mulligan he said	770.983521978863
Give us that key Kinch Buck Mulligan said to keep my chemise flat	3727.5937203149383
Stephen handed him the key	328.36511569890223
Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes	2903.2601932065677
And twopence he said for a pint	1384.5404451516638
Throw it there	21.840993118326033
Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap	2694.78913506113
Dressing undressing	1.1617274079423625
Buck Mulligan erect with joined hands before him said solemnly He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord	240.40991835099712
Thus spake Zarathustra	21.840993118326033
His plump body plunged	126.99109556487812
We ll see you again Haines said turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish	316.227766016838
Horn of a bull hoof of a horse smile of a Saxon	7017.038286703832
The Ship Buck Mulligan cried	348.29171113587296
Half twelve	1.1617274079423625
Good Stephen said	21.840993118326033
He walked along the upwardcurving path	787.0887026711796
Liliata rutilantium	1.1617274079423625
Turma circumdet	1.1617274079423625
Iubilantium te virginum	18.60036465451084
The priest s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly	7017.038286703832
I will not sleep here tonight	773.4676608087022
Home also I cannot go	410.6204064167453
A voice sweettoned and sustained called to him from the sea	6154.096757087656
Turning the curve he waved his hand	1780.428763062773
It called again	21.840993118326033
A sleek brown head a seal s far out on the water round	3727.5937203149383
Usurper	1.1617274079423625
You Cochrane what city sent for him	1780.428763062773
Tarentum sir	1.1617274079423625
Very good	1.1617274079423625
Well	1.1617274079423625
There was a battle sir	305.4025733674428
Very good	1.1617274079423625
Where	1.1617274079423625
The boy s blank face asked the blank window	4293.13994636419
Fabled by the daughters of memory	866.2253711860347
And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it	3727.5937203149383
A phrase then of impatience thud of Blake s wings of excess	7017.038286703832
I hear the ruin of all space shattered glass and toppling masonry and time one livid final flame	428.1332398719392
What s left us then	410.6204064167453
I forget the place sir	410.6204064167453
B	1.1617274079423625
C	1.1617274079423625
Asculum Stephen said glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book	3727.5937203149383
Yes sir	1.1617274079423625
And he said victory like that and we are done for That phrase the world had remembered	599.4842503189408
A dull ease of the mind	862.742811655988
Any general to any officers	410.6204064167453
They lend ear	21.840993118326033
You Armstrong Stephen said	126.99109556487812
What was the end of Pyrrhus	631.5705394034796
End of Pyrrhus sir	126.99109556487812
I know sir	21.840993118326033
Ask me sir Comyn said	367.1967010491309
Wait	1.1617274079423625
You Armstrong	1.1617274079423625
Do you know anything about Pyrrhus	634.5028688899017
A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong s satchel	5912.555183224002
He curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly	7017.038286703832
Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips	2903.2601932065677
A sweetened boy s breath	410.6204064167453
Welloff people proud that their eldest son was in the navy	5879.516330960441
Vico Road Dalkey	21.840993118326033
Pyrrhus sir	1.1617274079423625
Pyrrhus a pier	21.840993118326033
All laughed	1.1617274079423625
Mirthless high malicious laughter	126.99109556487812
Armstrong looked round at his classmates silly glee in profile	5912.555183224002
In a moment they will laugh more loudly aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay	187.38174228603845
Tell me now Stephen said poking the boy s shoulder with the book what is a pier	599.4842503189408
A pier sir Armstrong said	410.6204064167453
A kind of a bridge	278.8126919212251
Kingstown pier sir	21.840993118326033
Some laughed again mirthless but with meaning	1780.428763062773
Two in the back bench whispered	776.5898510338078
Yes	1.1617274079423625
They knew had never learned nor ever been innocent	4293.13994636419
All	1.1617274079423625
With envy he watched their faces Edith Ethel Gerty Lily	5912.555183224002
Their likes their breaths too sweetened with tea and jam their bracelets tittering in the struggle	873.3261623828432
Kingstown pier Stephen said	126.99109556487812
Yes a disappointed bridge	126.99109556487812
How sir	1.1617274079423625
Comyn asked	1.1617274079423625
A bridge is across a river	949.4860105710369
For Haines s chapbook	126.99109556487812
No one here to hear	367.1967010491309
Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk to pierce the polished mail of his mind	1333.521432163324
A jester at the court of his master indulged and disesteemed winning a clement master s praise	599.4842503189408
Why had they chosen all that part	1780.428763062773
Not wholly for the smooth caress	949.4860105710369
For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard their land a pawnshop	599.4842503189408
Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death	316.227766016838
They are not to be thought away	1158.9624469363189
Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted	316.227766016838
But can those have been possible seeing that they never were	7719.846677868277
Or was that only possible which came to pass	3754.265101828748
Weave weaver of the wind	410.6204064167453
Tell us a story sir	410.6204064167453
O do sir	21.840993118326033
A ghoststory	1.1617274079423625
Where do you begin in this	862.742811655988
Stephen asked opening another book	410.6204064167453
no more Comyn said	126.99109556487812
Go on then Talbot	126.99109556487812
And the story sir	126.99109556487812
After Stephen said	21.840993118326033
Go on Talbot	21.840993118326033
A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel	873.3261623828432
Aristotle s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read sheltered from the sin of Paris night by night	24.484367468222267
By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy	7719.846677868277
Fed and feeding brains about me under glowlamps impaled with faintly beating feelers and in my mind s darkness a sloth of the underworld reluctant shy of brightness shifting her dragon scaly folds	29.552092352028872
Thought is the thought of thought	949.4860105710369
Tranquil brightness	1.1617274079423625
The soul is in a manner all that is the soul is the form of forms	873.3261623828432
Tranquility sudden vast candescent form of forms	1618.137084703284
Talbot repeated Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves Through the dear might Turn over Stephen said quietly	187.38174228603845
I don t see anything	213.39470528336028
What sir	1.1617274079423625
Talbot asked simply bending forward	410.6204064167453
His hand turned the page over	949.4860105710369
He leaned back and went on again having just remembered	4633.03858951965
Of him that walked the waves	783.9243030199358
Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer s heart and lips and on mine	240.40991835099712
It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute	2154.4346900318833
To Caesar what is Caesar s to God what is God s	7017.038286703832
A long look from dark eyes a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church s looms	316.227766016838
Ay	1.1617274079423625
Riddle me riddle me randy ro	949.4860105710369
My father gave me seeds to sow	1780.428763062773
Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel	2903.2601932065677
Have I heard all	126.99109556487812
Stephen asked	1.1617274079423625
Yes sir	1.1617274079423625
Hockey at ten sir	126.99109556487812
Half day sir	21.840993118326033
Who can answer a riddle	410.6204064167453
Stephen asked	1.1617274079423625
They bundled their books away pencils clacking pages rustling	4293.13994636419
Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels all gabbling gaily A riddle sir	2154.4346900318833
Ask me sir	18.469695921350887
O ask me sir	126.99109556487812
A hard one sir	126.99109556487812
This is the riddle Stephen said The cock crew The sky was blue The bells in heaven Were striking eleven	240.40991835099712
Tis time for this poor soul To go to heaven	5233.841450267788
What is that	15.685352704529745
What sir	1.1617274079423625
Again sir	1.1617274079423625
We didn t hear	111.05117566129712
After a silence Cochrane said What is it sir	3281.223053587277
We give it up	111.05117566129712
Stephen his throat itching answered The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush	3727.5937203149383
He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay	873.3261623828432
They broke asunder sidling out of their benches leaping them	5315.9187681762505
Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues	240.40991835099712
Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly showing an open copybook	7017.038286703832
His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading	240.40991835099712
On his cheek dull and bloodless a soft stain of ink lay dateshaped recent and damp as a snail s bed	187.38174228603845
He held out his copybook	367.1967010491309
The word was written on the headline	1637.2623817614965
Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot	599.4842503189408
Cyril Sargent his name and seal	862.742811655988
Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again he said and show them to you sir	428.1332398719392
Stephen touched the edges of the book	1505.608178403045
Futility	1.1617274079423625
Do you understand how to do them now	2509.1370150228763
he asked	1.1617274079423625
Numbers eleven to fifteen Sargent answered	949.4860105710369
Can you do them yourself	368.9265519088789
Stephen asked	1.1617274079423625
No sir	1.1617274079423625
Ugly and futile lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink a snail s bed	599.4842503189408
Yet someone had loved him borne him in her arms and in her heart	2154.4346900318833
But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot a squashed boneless snail	599.4842503189408
She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own	7300.251061821653
Was that then real	126.99109556487812
The only true thing in life	712.3065003413024
His mother s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode	7017.038286703832
She was no more the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes	187.38174228603845
She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone scarcely having been	2154.4346900318833
A poor soul gone to heaven and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox red reek of rapine in his fur with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth listened scraped up the earth listened scraped and scraped	17.782794100389232
Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem	3977.110094220475
He proves by algebra that Shakespeare s ghost is Hamlet s grandfather	7017.038286703832
Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses	1780.428763062773
Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field	873.3261623828432
Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice in the mummery of their letters wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes	149.24955450518294
Give hands traverse bow to partner so imps of fancy of the Moors	3727.5937203149383
Gone too from the world Averroes and Moses Maimonides dark men in mien and movement flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend	22.456979955397745
Do you understand now	111.6792609014905
Can you work the second for yourself	1780.428763062773
Yes sir	1.1617274079423625
In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data	2903.2601932065677
Waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin	100.00000000000001
matris subjective and objective genitive	328.36511569890223
With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands	240.40991835099712
Like him was I these sloping shoulders this gracelessness	4293.13994636419
My childhood bends beside me	410.6204064167453
Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly	7017.038286703832
Mine is far and his secret as our eyes	4293.13994636419
Secrets silent stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts secrets weary of their tyranny tyrants willing to be dethroned	149.24955450518294
The sum was done	126.99109556487812
It is very simple Stephen said as he stood up	4583.695799538325
Yes sir	1.1617274079423625
He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench	428.1332398719392
You had better get your stick and go out to the others Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy s graceless form	83.76776400682921
Yes sir	1.1617274079423625
In the corridor his name was heard called from the playfield	6903.461660503397
Sargent	1.1617274079423625
Run on Stephen said	126.99109556487812
Mr Deasy is calling you	410.6204064167453
He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife	240.40991835099712
They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet	428.1332398719392
When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him	7017.038286703832
What is it now	74.18134219204656
he cried continually without listening	410.6204064167453
Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side sir Stephen said	6051.178832011447
Will you wait in my study for a moment Mr Deasy said till I restore order here	599.4842503189408
And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man s voice cried sternly What is the matter	240.40991835099712
What is it now	74.18134219204656
Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides their many forms closed round him the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head	83.76776400682921
Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs	599.4842503189408
As on the first day he bargained with me here	5247.276053407287
As it was in the beginning is now	1860.6305256303488
On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins base treasure of a bog and ever shall be	599.4842503189408
And snug in their spooncase of purple plush faded the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles world without end	187.38174228603845
A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor	6135.203843089739
Blowing out his rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table	6849.595667344243
First our little financial settlement he said	1780.428763062773
He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong	3727.5937203149383
It slapped open and he took from it two notes one of joined halves and laid them carefully on the table	187.38174228603845
Two he said strapping and stowing his pocketbook away	4293.13994636419
And now his strongroom for the gold	1637.2623817614965
Stephen s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar whelks and money cowries and leopard shells and this whorled as an emir s turban and this the scallop of saint James	22.456979955397745
An old pilgrim s hoard dead treasure hollow shells	4293.13994636419
A sovereign fell bright and new on the soft pile of the tablecloth	3727.5937203149383
Three Mr Deasy said turning his little savingsbox about in his hand	6509.060501243755
These are handy things to have	949.4860105710369
This is for sovereigns	111.05117566129712
This is for shillings	111.05117566129712
Sixpences halfcrowns	1.1617274079423625
And here crowns	21.840993118326033
See	1.1617274079423625
He shot from it two crowns and two shillings	4014.671278934556
Three twelve he said	126.99109556487812
I think you ll find that s right	2343.606685126679
Thank you sir Stephen said gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers	149.24955450518294
No thanks at all Mr Deasy said	1112.1996695511136
You have earned it	126.99109556487812
Stephen s hand free again went back to the hollow shells	6310.655157003836
Symbols too of beauty and of power	1505.608178403045
A lump in my pocket symbols soiled by greed and misery	7719.846677868277
Don t carry it like that Mr Deasy said	3159.739748819386
You ll pull it out somewhere and lose it	4293.13994636419
You just buy one of these machines	1488.020769087348
You ll find them very handy	949.4860105710369
Answer something	1.1617274079423625
Mine would be often empty Stephen said	1780.428763062773
The same room and hour the same wisdom and I the same	7017.038286703832
Three times now	21.840993118326033
Three nooses round me here	410.6204064167453
Well	1.1617274079423625
I can break them in this instant if I will	5912.555183224002
Because you don t save Mr Deasy said pointing his finger	5332.252116777513
You don t know yet what money is	1931.1806253836407
Money is power	21.840993118326033
When you have lived as long as I have	3294.982585458825
I know I know	108.9829112695572
If youth but knew	111.05117566129712
But what does Shakespeare say	410.6204064167453
but money in thy purse Iago Stephen murmured	2903.2601932065677
He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man s stare	2154.4346900318833
He knew what money was Mr Deasy said	2218.0488766924223
He made money	21.840993118326033
A poet yes but an Englishman too	1780.428763062773
Do you know what is the pride of the English	3152.807155945954
Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman s mouth	599.4842503189408
His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay it seems history is to blame on me and on my words unhating	187.38174228603845
That on his empire Stephen said the sun never sets	5562.856855515288
Ba	1.1617274079423625
Mr Deasy cried	21.840993118326033
That s not English	111.6792609014905
A French Celt said that	410.6204064167453
He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail	1637.2623817614965
I will tell you he said solemnly what is his proudest boast	6603.764344041636
paid my way Good man good man	1573.62613429214
I paid my way	89.44612641887211
I never borrowed a shilling in my life Can you feel that	7017.038286703832
owe nothing Can you	126.99109556487812
Curran ten guineas	21.840993118326033
McCann one guinea	21.840993118326033
Fred Ryan two shillings	126.99109556487812
Temple two lunches	21.840993118326033
Russell one guinea Cousins ten shillings Bob Reynolds half a guinea Koehler three guineas Mrs MacKernan five weeks board	316.227766016838
The lump I have is useless	949.4860105710369
For the moment no Stephen answered	949.4860105710369
Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight putting back his savingsbox	5912.555183224002
I knew you couldn t he said joyously	2506.0203003523443
But one day you must feel it	1780.428763062773
We are a generous people but we must also be just	7300.251061821653
Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs Albert Edward prince of Wales	83.76776400682921
You think me an old fogey and an old tory his thoughtful voice said	2154.4346900318833
I saw three generations since O Connell s time	4293.13994636419
I remember the famine in	367.1967010491309
Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before O Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue	36.51741272548377
You fenians forget some things	410.6204064167453
Glorious pious and immortal memory	410.6204064167453
The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes	3727.5937203149383
Hoarse masked and armed the planters covenant	1780.428763062773
Croppies lie down	21.840993118326033
Stephen sketched a brief gesture	410.6204064167453
I have rebel blood in me too Mr Deasy said	4743.7042484262365
On the spindle side	126.99109556487812
But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union	3727.5937203149383
We are all Irish all kings sons	1643.043796432458
Alas Stephen said	21.840993118326033
vias Mr Deasy said firmly was his motto	2218.0488766924223
He voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so	187.38174228603845
Lal the ral the ra The rocky road to Dublin	4949.598146384639
A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots	2903.2601932065677
Soft day sir John	97.11203420129426
Soft day your honour	97.11203420129426
Day	1.1617274079423625
Day	1.1617274079423625
Two topboots jog dangling on to Dublin	1780.428763062773
Lal the ral the ra	296.4131996673495
That reminds me Mr Deasy said	610.3265458506489
You can do me a favour Mr Dedalus with some of your literary friends	2154.4346900318833
I have a letter here for the press	2262.0190059919587
Sit down a moment	126.99109556487812
I have just to copy the end	1643.043796432458
He went to the desk near the window pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter	61.05402296585327
Sit down	1.1617274079423625
Excuse me he said over his shoulder dictates of common sense Just a moment	2154.4346900318833
He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and muttering began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error	20.691380811147894
Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence	2903.2601932065677
Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage their meek heads poised in air lord Hastings the duke of Westminster s the duke of Beaufort s de	41.011270705513006
Elfin riders sat them watchful of a sign	2903.2601932065677
He saw their speeds backing king s colours and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds	873.3261623828432
Full stop Mr Deasy bade his keys	1780.428763062773
prompt ventilation of this allimportant question Where Cranly led me to get rich quick hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen over the motley slush	19.14481976169958
Even money Rebel Ten to one the field	2196.3460798944475
Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman a butcher s dame nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange	46.415888336127786
Shouts rang shrill from the boys playfield and a whirring whistle	7719.846677868277
Again a goal	21.840993118326033
I am among them among their battling bodies in a medley the joust of life	1333.521432163324
You mean that knockkneed mother s darling who seems to be slightly crawsick	3727.5937203149383
Jousts	1.1617274079423625
Time shocked rebounds shock by shock	949.4860105710369
Jousts slush and uproar of battles the frozen deathspew of the slain a shout of spearspikes baited with men s bloodied guts	149.24955450518294
Now then Mr Deasy said rising	671.6909249617759
He came to the table pinning together his sheets	3144.5805136110102
Stephen stood up	18.469695921350887
I have put the matter into a nutshell Mr Deasy said	6308.448171452775
It s about the foot and mouth disease	1882.0197844220902
Just look through it	126.99109556487812
There can be no two opinions on the matter	3520.6638989827165
May I trespass on your valuable space	1505.608178403045
That doctrine of which so often in our history	4293.13994636419

To come to the point at issue	1389.4294614335427
I don t mince words do I	1199.0608564151505
Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on	1643.043796432458
Foot and mouth disease	83.62496143349232

In every sense of the word take the bull by the horns	6710.980351155286
Thanking you for the hospitality of your columns	2336.2750273279153
I want that to be printed and read Mr Deasy said	5654.593018753952
You will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle	1333.521432163324
And it can be cured	410.6204064167453
It is cured	21.840993118326033
My cousin Blackwood Price writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there	428.1332398719392
They offer to come over here	949.4860105710369
I am trying to work up influence with the department	5233.841450267788
Now I m going to try publicity	1178.8527082485589
I am surrounded by difficulties by	949.4860105710369
intrigues by	1.1617274079423625
backstairs influence by	21.840993118326033
He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke	3727.5937203149383
Mark my words Mr Dedalus he said	1643.043796432458
England is in the hands of the jews	1875.3502429841103
In all the highest places her finance her press	4293.13994636419
And they are the signs of a nation s decay	4924.2856751531135
Wherever they gather they eat up the nation s vital strength	7719.846677868277
I have seen it coming these years	1780.428763062773
As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction	599.4842503189408
Old England is dying	126.99109556487812
He stepped swiftly off his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam	873.3261623828432
He faced about and back again	718.0687193249254
Dying he said again if not dead by now	4026.008396445538
The harlot s cry from street to street Shall weave old England s windingsheet	2154.4346900318833
His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted	1333.521432163324
A merchant Stephen said is one who buys cheap and sells dear jew or gentile is he not	428.1332398719392
They sinned against the light Mr Deasy said gravely	3150.8420175409037
And you can see the darkness in their eyes	3754.265101828748
And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day	3727.5937203149383
On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers	599.4842503189408
Gabble of geese	21.840993118326033
They swarmed loud uncouth about the temple their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats	2154.4346900318833
Not theirs these clothes this speech these gestures	2903.2601932065677
Their full slow eyes belied the words the gestures eager and unoffending but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain	83.76776400682921
Vain patience to heap and hoard	949.4860105710369
Time surely would scatter all	410.6204064167453
A hoard heaped by the roadside plundered and passing on	5562.856855515288
Their eyes knew their years of wandering and patient knew the dishonours of their flesh	1333.521432163324
Who has not	21.840993118326033
Stephen said	1.1617274079423625
What do you mean	81.4931607871175
Mr Deasy asked	18.60036465451084
He came forward a pace and stood by the table	4882.384603483692
His underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly	949.4860105710369
Is this old wisdom	126.99109556487812
He waits to hear from me	862.742811655988
History Stephen said is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake	3727.5937203149383
From the playfield the boys raised a shout	2903.2601932065677
A whirring whistle goal	126.99109556487812
What if that nightmare gave you a back kick	4293.13994636419
The ways of the Creator are not our ways Mr Deasy said	6893.042593277109
All human history moves towards one great goal the manifestation of God	7017.038286703832
Hooray	1.1617274079423625
Ay	1.1617274079423625
Whrrwhee	1.1617274079423625
What	1.1617274079423625
Mr Deasy asked	18.60036465451084
A shout in the street Stephen answered shrugging his shoulders	4991.2804500073835
Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers	599.4842503189408
Looking up again he set them free	1780.428763062773
I am happier than you are he said	2694.78913506113
We have committed many errors and many sins	2903.2601932065677
A woman brought sin into the world	1125.3206448831193
For a woman who was no better than she should be Helen the runaway wife of Menelaus ten years the Greeks made war on Troy	83.76776400682921
A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here MacMurrough s wife and her leman O Rourke prince of Breffni	149.24955450518294
A woman too brought Parnell low	949.4860105710369
Many errors many failures but not the one sin	4014.671278934556
I am a struggler now at the end of my days	4648.135559798811
But I will fight for the right till the end	5562.856855515288
For Ulster will fight And Ulster will be right	4293.13994636419
Stephen raised the sheets in his hand	1159.9753654782683
Well sir he began	126.99109556487812
I foresee Mr Deasy said that you will not remain here very long at this work	873.3261623828432
You were not born to be a teacher I think	4764.791535231487
Perhaps I am wrong	126.99109556487812
A learner rather Stephen said	410.6204064167453
And here what will you learn more	1637.2623817614965
Mr Deasy shook his head	361.48876812228025
Who knows	1.1617274079423625
he said	1.1617274079423625
To learn one must be humble	949.4860105710369
But life is the great teacher	862.742811655988
Stephen rustled the sheets again	367.1967010491309
As regards these he began	410.6204064167453
Yes Mr Deasy said	78.22157285940469
You have two copies there	410.6204064167453
If you can have them published at once	2694.78913506113
Telegraph	1.1617274079423625
Irish Homestead I will try Stephen said and let you know tomorrow	7017.038286703832
I know two editors slightly	410.6204064167453
That will do Mr Deasy said briskly	983.0140373299553
I wrote last night to Mr Field M P	4014.671278934556
There is a meeting of the cattletraders association today at the City Arms hotel	2154.4346900318833
I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting	4931.907717140106
You see if you can get it into your two papers	6040.716939329411
What are they	21.840993118326033
The Evening Telegraph That will do Mr Deasy said	2669.3353627898337
There is no time to lose	824.5274024412339
Now I have to answer that letter from my cousin	5515.522139545052
Good morning sir Stephen said putting the sheets in his pocket	4797.828016977228
Thank you	1.1617274079423625
Not at all Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk	2154.4346900318833
I like to break a lance with you old as I am	7017.038286703832
Good morning sir Stephen said again bowing to his bent back	6308.356683939008
He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield	61.05402296585327
The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate toothless terrors	1333.521432163324
Still I will help him in his fight	2601.4832449920805
Mulligan will dub me a new name the bullockbefriending bard	5912.555183224002
Mr Dedalus	1.1617274079423625
Running after me	21.840993118326033
No more letters I hope	410.6204064167453
Just one moment	21.840993118326033
Yes sir Stephen said turning back at the gate	3189.525901359734
Mr Deasy halted breathing hard and swallowing his breath	4014.671278934556
I just wanted to say he said	1368.3672602073261
Ireland they say has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews	873.3261623828432
Do you know that	61.70573686146372
No	1.1617274079423625
And do you know why	329.2975248401484
He frowned sternly on the bright air	1637.2623817614965
Why sir	1.1617274079423625
Stephen asked beginning to smile	410.6204064167453
Because she never let them in Mr Deasy said solemnly	4199.165192346928
A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm	873.3261623828432
She never let them in he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path	121.15276586285881
That s why	15.685352704529745
On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles dancing coins	1333.521432163324
Ineluctable modality of the visible at least that if no more thought through my eyes	1333.521432163324
Signatures of all things I am here to read seaspawn and seawrack the nearing tide that rusty boot	428.1332398719392

But he adds in bodies	410.6204064167453
Then he was aware of them bodies before of them coloured	7300.251061821653

If you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate if not a door	599.4842503189408
Shut your eyes and see	329.912032313567
Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells	3727.5937203149383
You are walking through it howsomever	949.4860105710369
I am a stride at a time	1328.8721689541608
A very short space of time through very short times of space	7017.038286703832
Five six the	21.840993118326033
Exactly and that is the ineluctable modality of the audible	4389.7027837905625

Tap with it they do	410.6204064167453
My two feet in his boots are at the ends of his legs	3727.5937203149383
Sounds solid made by the mallet of	1780.428763062773

If I open and am for ever in the black adiaphane	6492.5399100633085
I will see if I can see	1240.1406776179274
There all the time without you and ever shall be world without end	3727.5937203149383
They came down the steps from Leahy s terrace prudently and down the shelving shore flabbily their splayed feet sinking in the silted sand	100.00000000000001
Like me like Algy coming down to our mighty mother	5562.856855515288

Then from the starving cagework city a horde of jerkined dwarfs my people with flayers knives running scaling hacking in green blubbery whalemeat	121.15276586285881
Famine plague and slaughters	126.99109556487812
Their blood is in me their lusts my waves	4293.13994636419
I moved among them on the frozen Liffey that I a changeling among the spluttering resin fires	599.4842503189408

The dog s bark ran towards him stopped ran back	5912.555183224002

I just simply stood pale silent bayed about	2903.2601932065677
	1.1617274079423625
A primrose doublet fortune s knave smiled on my fear	5912.555183224002
For that are you pining the bark of their applause	5912.555183224002
Pretenders live their lives	126.99109556487812
The Bruce s brother Thomas Fitzgerald silken knight Perkin Warbeck York s false scion in breeches of silk of whiterose ivory wonder of a day and Lambert Simnel with a tail of nans and sutlers a scullion crowned	19.14481976169958

Can t see	18.040717293319346
Who s behind me	126.99109556487812

I want his life still to be his mine to be mine	7017.038286703832
A drowning man	21.840993118326033

Pinned up I bet	126.99109556487812
Their dog ambled about a bank of dwindling sand trotting sniffing on all sides	2154.4346900318833
Looking for something lost in a past life	2321.680448289125
Suddenly he made off like a bounding hare ears flung back chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull	428.1332398719392
The man s shrieked whistle struck his limp ears	4293.13994636419
He turned bounded back came nearer trotted on twinkling shanks	5912.555183224002
On a field tenney a buck trippant proper unattired	4293.13994636419
At the lacefringe of the tide he halted with stiff forehoofs seawardpointed ears	3727.5937203149383
His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise herds of seamorse	5912.555183224002
They serpented towards his feet curling unfurling many crests every ninth breaking plashing from far from farther out waves and waves	187.38174228603845
Cocklepickers	1.1617274079423625
They waded a little way in the water and stooping soused their bags and lifting them again waded out	316.227766016838
The dog yelped running to them reared up and pawed them dropping on all fours again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning	100.00000000000001
Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand a rag of wolf s tongue redpanting from his jaws	149.24955450518294
His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf s gallop	873.3261623828432
The carcass lay on his path	862.742811655988
He stopped sniffed stalked round it brother nosing closer went round it sniffling rapidly like a dog all over the dead dog s bedraggled fell	83.76776400682921

Out of that you mongrel	367.1967010491309
The cry brought him skulking back to his master and a blunt bootless kick sent him unscathed across a spit of sand crouched in flight	83.76776400682921
He slunk back in a curve	824.5274024412339
Doesn t see me	97.6612821940667
Along by the edge of the mole he lolloped dawdled smelt a rock and from under a cocked hindleg pissed against it	149.24955450518294
He trotted forward and lifting again his hindleg pissed quick short at an unsmelt rock	1333.521432163324
The simple pleasures of the poor	866.2253711860347
His hindpaws then scattered the sand then his forepaws dabbled and delved	7017.038286703832
Something he buried there his grandmother	949.4860105710369
He rooted in the sand dabbling delving and stopped to listen to the air scraped up the sand again with a fury of his claws soon ceasing a pard a panther got in spousebreach vulturing the dead	20.691380811147894

I remember	1.1617274079423625
Did I not take it up	949.4860105710369
His hand groped vainly in his pockets	1780.428763062773
No I didn t	83.6666059359537
Better buy one	21.840993118326033
For the rest let look who will	1643.043796432458
Behind	1.1617274079423625
Perhaps there is someone	126.99109556487812
He turned his face over a shoulder rere regardant	4026.008396445538
Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster her sails brailed up on the crosstrees homing upstream silently moving a silent ship	121.15276586285881
II Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls	2154.4346900318833
He liked thick giblet soup nutty gizzards a stuffed roast heart liverslices fried with crustcrumbs fried hencods roes	428.1332398719392
Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine	240.40991835099712
Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray	240.40991835099712
Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere	873.3261623828432
Made him feel a bit peckish	949.4860105710369
The coals were reddening	126.99109556487812
Another slice of bread and butter three four right	3729.642833208875
She didn t like her plate full	1315.1822859664637
Right	1.1617274079423625
He turned from the tray lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire	428.1332398719392
It sat there dull and squat its spout stuck out	5912.555183224002
Cup of tea soon	111.05117566129712
Mouth dry	1.1617274079423625
The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high	2154.4346900318833
Mkgnao	1.1617274079423625
O there you are Mr Bloom said turning from the fire	4538.207870621358
The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table mewing	873.3261623828432
Just how she stalks over my writingtable	1780.428763062773
Prr	1.1617274079423625
Scratch my head	21.840993118326033
Prr	1.1617274079423625
Mr Bloom watched curiously kindly the lithe black form	4014.671278934556
Clean to see the gloss of her sleek hide the white button under the butt of her tail the green flashing eyes	149.24955450518294
He bent down to her his hands on his knees	3994.8766051528364
Mrkgnao	1.1617274079423625
the cat cried	21.840993118326033
They call them stupid	126.99109556487812
They understand what we say better than we understand them	5912.555183224002
She understands all she wants to	949.4860105710369
Vindictive too	1.1617274079423625
Cruel	1.1617274079423625
Her nature	1.1617274079423625
Curious mice never squeal	126.99109556487812
Seem to like it	111.05117566129712
Height of a tower	111.05117566129712
No she can jump me	410.6204064167453
Afraid of the chickens she is he said mockingly	3520.663898982717
Afraid of the chookchooks	111.05117566129712
I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens	5562.856855515288
Mrkrgnao	1.1617274079423625
the cat said loudly	126.99109556487812
She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes mewing plaintively and long showing him her milkwhite teeth	428.1332398719392
He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones	2154.4346900318833
Then he went to the dresser took the jug Hanlon s milkman had just filled for him poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor	41.011270705513006
Gurrhr	1.1617274079423625
she cried running to lap	367.1967010491309
He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly	428.1332398719392
Wonder is it true if you clip them they can t mouse after	3727.5937203149383
Why	1.1617274079423625
They shine in the dark perhaps the tips	1874.283818240706
Or kind of feelers in the dark perhaps	2019.2799241585253
He listened to her licking lap	949.4860105710369
Ham and eggs no	126.99109556487812
No good eggs with this drouth	949.4860105710369
Want pure fresh water	126.99109556487812
Thursday not a good day either for a mutton kidney at Buckley s	3727.5937203149383
Fried with butter a shake of pepper	1637.2623817614965
Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz s	1637.2623817614965
While the kettle is boiling	367.1967010491309
She lapped slower then licking the saucer clean	2903.2601932065677
Why are their tongues so rough	949.4860105710369
To lap better all porous holes	949.4860105710369
Nothing she can eat	126.99109556487812
He glanced round him	126.99109556487812
No	1.1617274079423625
On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall paused by the bedroom door	599.4842503189408
She might like something tasty	410.6204064167453
Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning	3136.6291947929612
Still perhaps once in a way	595.3389214672508
He said softly in the bare hall I m going round the corner	3727.5937203149383
Be back in a minute	295.42398319784866
And when he had heard his voice say it he added You don t want anything for breakfast	428.1332398719392
A sleepy soft grunt answered Mn	949.4860105710369
No	1.1617274079423625
She didn t want anything	274.1925563156212
He heard then a warm heavy sigh softer as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled	187.38174228603845
Pity	1.1617274079423625
All the way from Gibraltar	410.6204064167453
Forgotten any little Spanish she knew	949.4860105710369
Wonder what her father gave for it	1780.428763062773
Old style	1.1617274079423625
Ah yes	1.1617274079423625
of course	1.1617274079423625
Bought it at the governor s auction	1573.62613429214
Got a short knock	111.05117566129712
Hard as nails at a bargain old Tweedy	2694.78913506113
Yes sir	1.1617274079423625
At Plevna that was	126.99109556487812
I rose from the ranks sir and I m proud of it	7017.038286703832
Still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps	6903.461660503397
Now that was farseeing	126.99109556487812
His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof	240.40991835099712
Stamps stickyback pictures	21.840993118326033
Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too	4026.008396445538
Course they do	21.840993118326033
The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely Plasto s high grade ha	599.4842503189408
He peeped quickly inside the leather headband	1488.020769087348
White slip of paper	111.05117566129712
Quite safe	1.1617274079423625
On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey	7017.038286703832
Not there	1.1617274079423625
In the trousers I left off	862.742811655988
Must get it	21.840993118326033
Potato I have	21.840993118326033
Creaky wardrobe	1.1617274079423625
No use disturbing her	126.99109556487812
She turned over sleepily that time	949.4860105710369
He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly more till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold a limp lid	187.38174228603845
Looked shut	1.1617274079423625
All right till I come back anyhow	1780.428763062773
He crossed to the bright side avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive	3727.5937203149383
The sun was nearing the steeple of George s church	5145.150198027183
Be a warm day I fancy	949.4860105710369
Specially in these black clothes feel it more	2903.2601932065677
Black conducts reflects refracts is it the heat	2703.245875619065
But I couldn t go in that light suit	3594.46570131372
His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth	6622.022685241786
Boland s breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterday s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot	428.1332398719392
Makes you feel young	126.99109556487812
Somewhere in the east early morning set off at dawn	5912.555183224002
Travel round in front of the sun steal a day s march on him	2154.4346900318833
Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically	7300.251061821653
Walk along a strand strange land come to a city gate sentry there old ranker too old Tweedy s big moustaches leaning on a long kind of a spear	46.415888336127786
Wander through awned streets	126.99109556487812
Turbaned faces going by	126.99109556487812
Dark caves of carpet shops big man Turko the terrible seated crosslegged smoking a coiled pipe	873.3261623828432
Cries of sellers in the streets	949.4860105710369
Drink water scented with fennel sherbet	949.4860105710369
Dander along all day	126.99109556487812
Might meet a robber or two	949.4860105710369
Well meet him	21.840993118326033
Getting on to sundown	126.99109556487812
A shiver of the trees signal the evening wind	4014.671278934556
I pass on	21.840993118326033
Fading gold sky	21.840993118326033
A mother watches me from her doorway	1780.428763062773
She calls her children home in their dark language	4293.13994636419
Night sky moon violet colour of Molly s new garters	5233.841450267788
Strings	1.1617274079423625
Listen	1.1617274079423625
A girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them dulcimers	3727.5937203149383
I pass	1.1617274079423625
Probably not a bit like it really	1643.043796432458
Kind of stuff you read in the track of the sun	5485.259104827001
Sunburst on the titlepage	126.99109556487812
He smiled pleasing himself	126.99109556487812
What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the leader a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland	71.09709432312432
He prolonged his pleased smile	410.6204064167453
Ikey touch that homerule sun rising up in the northwest	3659.752935013315
He approached Larry O Rourke s	773.4676608087022
From the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter	7719.846677868277
Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger teadust biscuitmush	3727.5937203149383
Good house however just the end of the city traffic	3871.7459394748444
For instance M Auley s down there n	2694.78913506113
g	1.1617274079423625
as position	1.1617274079423625
Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot	100.00000000000001
Baldhead over the blind	126.99109556487812
Cute old codger	21.840993118326033
No use canvassing him for an ad	1510.9247026866935
Still he knows his own business best	1510.9247026866935
There he is sure enough my bold Larry leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket	83.76776400682921
Simon Dedalus takes him off to a tee with his eyes screwed up	3727.5937203149383
Do you know what I m going to tell you	2253.105067130784
What s that Mr O Rourke	603.1485810584873
Do you know what	55.17189907478565
The Russians they d only be an eight o clock breakfast for the Japanese	2154.4346900318833
Stop and say a word about the funeral perhaps	3477.9033107243026
Sad thing about poor Dignam Mr O Rourke	2703.245875619065
Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway Good day Mr O Rourke	599.4842503189408
Good day to you	126.99109556487812
Lovely weather sir	21.840993118326033
Tis all that	21.840993118326033
Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim rinsing empties and old man in the cellar	873.3261623828432
Then lo and behold they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons	3727.5937203149383
Then think of the competition	329.2975248401484
General thirst	1.1617274079423625
Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub	5912.555183224002
Save it they can t	337.8673804303916
Off the drunks perhaps	126.99109556487812
Put down three and carry five	949.4860105710369
What is that a bob here and there dribs and drabs	5374.107610573046
On the wholesale orders perhaps	410.6204064167453
Doing a double shuffle with the town travellers	2903.2601932065677
Square it you with the boss and we ll split the job see	3727.5937203149383
How much would that tot to off the porter in the month	7017.038286703832
Say ten barrels of stuff	410.6204064167453
Say he got ten per cent off	1780.428763062773
O more	1.1617274079423625
Fifteen	1.1617274079423625
He passed Saint Joseph s National school	1643.043796432458
Brats clamour	1.1617274079423625
Windows open	1.1617274079423625

Slieve Bloom	1.1617274079423625
He halted before Dlugacz s window staring at the hanks of sausages polonies black and white	873.3261623828432
Fifteen multiplied by	21.840993118326033
The figures whitened in his mind unsolved displeased he let them fade	7017.038286703832
The shiny links packed with forcemeat fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs blood	149.24955450518294
A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish the last	5912.555183224002
He stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter	3487.7246374995248
Would she buy it too calling the items from a slip in her hand	2154.4346900318833
Chapped washingsoda	1.1617274079423625
And a pound and a half of Denny s sausages	4335.258537756623
His eyes rested on her vigorous hips	1780.428763062773
Woods his name is	100.49400469796984
Wonder what he does	97.6612821940667
Wife is oldish	21.840993118326033
New blood	1.1617274079423625
No followers allowed	21.840993118326033
Strong pair of arms	126.99109556487812
Whacking a carpet on the clothesline	949.4860105710369
She does whack it by George	949.4860105710369
The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack	4293.13994636419
The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers sausagepink	2154.4346900318833
Sound meat there like a stallfed heifer	1780.428763062773
He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets the model farm at Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias	187.38174228603845
Can become ideal winter sanatorium	410.6204064167453
Moses Montefiore	1.1617274079423625
I thought he was	85.54202659722401
Farmhouse wall round it blurred cattle cropping	1637.2623817614965
He held the page from him interesting read it nearer the title the blurred cropping cattle the page rustling	316.227766016838
A young white heifer	126.99109556487812
Those mornings in the cattlemarket the beasts lowing in their pens branded sheep flop and fall of dung the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter there s a prime one unpeeled switches in their hands	12.91549665014884
He held the page aslant patiently bending his senses and his will his soft subject gaze at rest	428.1332398719392
The crooked skirt swinging whack by whack by whack	3283.0298175454755
The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace	428.1332398719392
Now my miss he said	367.1967010491309
She tendered a coin smiling boldly holding her thick wrist out	7719.846677868277
Thank you my miss	126.99109556487812
For you please	21.840993118326033
Mr Bloom pointed quickly	126.99109556487812
To catch up and walk behind her if she went slowly behind her moving hams	1333.521432163324
Pleasant to see first thing in the morning	1854.8097936831198
Hurry up damn it	126.99109556487812
Make hay while the sun shines	866.2253711860347
She stood outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right	3727.5937203149383
He sighed down his nose they never understand	2903.2601932065677
Sodachapped hands	1.1617274079423625
Crusted toenails too	21.840993118326033
Brown scapulars in tatters defending her both ways	2903.2601932065677
The sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast	7300.251061821653
For another a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles Lane	7719.846677868277
They like them sizeable	126.99109556487812
Prime sausage	1.1617274079423625
O please Mr Policeman I m lost in the wood	5233.841450267788
Threepence please	1.1617274079423625
Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles	599.4842503189408
They lay were read quickly and quickly slid disc by disc into the till	2154.4346900318833
Thank you sir	17.06185700055526
Another time	1.1617274079423625
A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him	4014.671278934556
He withdrew his gaze after an instant	1505.608178403045
No better not another time	410.6204064167453
Good morning he said moving away	949.4860105710369
Good morning sir	18.040717293319346
No sign	1.1617274079423625
Gone	1.1617274079423625
What matter	1.1617274079423625

Still an idea behind it	367.1967010491309
He looked at the cattle blurred in silver heat	3684.3440696467324
Quiet long days pruning ripening	410.6204064167453
Olives are packed in jars eh	949.4860105710369

Wonder is poor Citron still in Saint Kevin s parade	5247.276053407287
And Mastiansky with the old cither	851.2348218321658
Pleasant evenings we had then	410.6204064167453

Coming all that way Spain Gibraltar Mediterranean the Levant	4293.13994636419
Crates lined up on the quayside at Jaffa chap ticking them off in a book navvies handling them barefoot in soiled dungarees	149.24955450518294

Watering cart	1.1617274079423625
To provoke the rain	126.99109556487812
On earth as it is in heaven	1505.608178403045
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly wholly	2692.305562436855
Grey	1.1617274079423625
Far	1.1617274079423625
No not like that	100.49400469796984
A barren land bare waste	410.6204064167453
Vulcanic lake the dead sea no fish weedless sunk deep in the earth	3727.5937203149383
No wind could lift those waves grey metal poisonous foggy waters	7719.846677868277
Brimstone they called it raining down the cities of the plain Sodom Gomorrah Edom	2154.4346900318833

The oldest people	21.840993118326033
Wandered far away over all the earth captivity to captivity multiplying dying being born everywhere	1333.521432163324
It lay there now	126.99109556487812
Now it could bear no more	862.742811655988
Dead an old woman s the grey sunken cunt of the world	6876.419169290794
Desolation	1.1617274079423625
Grey horror seared his flesh	410.6204064167453
Folding the page into his pocket he turned into Eccles street hurrying homeward	3727.5937203149383
Cold oils slid along his veins chilling his blood age crusting him with a salt cloak	873.3261623828432
Well I am here now	329.912032313567
Yes I am here now	329.912032313567
Morning mouth bad images	126.99109556487812
Got up wrong side of the bed	1010.4162464711093
Must begin again those Sandow s exercises	1637.2623817614965

Blotchy brown brick houses	126.99109556487812

Valuation is only twentyeight	126.99109556487812
Towers Battersby North MacArthur parlour windows plastered with bills	4293.13994636419
Plasters on a sore eye	410.6204064167453
To smell the gentle smoke of tea fume of the pan sizzling butter	3727.5937203149383
Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh	949.4860105710369
Yes yes	1.1617274079423625
Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road swiftly in slim sandals along the brightening footpath	873.3261623828432
Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor	3754.265101828748
He stooped and gathered them	367.1967010491309
Mrs Marion Bloom	18.040717293319346
His quickened heart slowed at once	949.4860105710369
Mrs Marion	1.1617274079423625
Poldy	1.1617274079423625
Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head	599.4842503189408
Who are the letters for	410.6204064167453
He looked at them	93.52840760965191
Milly	1.1617274079423625
A letter for me from Milly he said carefully and a card to you	2154.4346900318833
And a letter for you	410.6204064167453
He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees	873.3261623828432
Do you want the blind up	714.0398318352517
Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow	121.15276586285881
he asked turning	21.840993118326033
She was reading the card propped on her elbow	4293.13994636419
She got the things she said	949.4860105710369
He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh	428.1332398719392
Hurry up with that tea she said	1643.043796432458
I m parched	21.840993118326033
The kettle is boiling he said	862.742811655988
But he delayed to clear the chair her striped petticoat tossed soiled linen and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed	71.09709432312432
As he went down the kitchen stairs she called Poldy	5085.097784126136
What	1.1617274079423625
Scald the teapot	21.840993118326033
On the boil sure enough a plume of steam from the spout	7017.038286703832
He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in	83.76776400682921
Having set it to draw he took off the kettle crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt	61.05402296585327
While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him	7719.846677868277
Give her too much meat she won t mouse	4026.008396445538
Say they won t eat pork	783.9243030199358
Kosher	1.1617274079423625
Here	1.1617274079423625
He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce	599.4842503189408
Pepper	1.1617274079423625
He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup	7719.846677868277
Then he slit open his letter glancing down the page and over	7017.038286703832
Thanks new tam Mr Coghlan lough Owel picnic young student Blazes Boylan s seaside girls	1333.521432163324
The tea was drawn	126.99109556487812
He filled his own moustachecup sham crown Derby smiling	4293.13994636419
Silly Milly s birthday gift	410.6204064167453
Only five she was then	410.6204064167453
No wait four	21.840993118326033
I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke	2475.298852735907
Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her	7300.251061821653
He smiled pouring	21.840993118326033
O Milly Bloom you are my darling	1780.428763062773
You are my lookingglass from night to morning	2694.78913506113
I d rather have you without a farthing Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden	873.3261623828432
Poor old professor Goodwin	126.99109556487812
Dreadful old case	21.840993118326033
Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform	4696.070955566602
And the little mirror in his silk hat	2666.78996584088
The night Milly brought it into the parlour	2469.1133923535576
O look what I found in professor Goodwin s hat	5562.856855515288
All we laughed	21.840993118326033
Sex breaking out even then	410.6204064167453
Pert little piece she was	410.6204064167453
He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over then fitted the teapot on the tray	428.1332398719392
Everything on it	21.840993118326033
Bread and butter four sugar spoon her cream	2903.2601932065677
Yes	1.1617274079423625
He carried it upstairs his thumb hooked in the teapot handle	7300.251061821653
Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead	187.38174228603845
What a time you were	410.6204064167453
she said	1.1617274079423625
She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly an elbow on the pillow	1333.521432163324
He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat s udder	149.24955450518294
The warmth of her couched body rose on the air mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured	316.227766016838
A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow	7109.842500848915
In the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread	7109.842500848915
Who was the letter from	367.1967010491309
Bold hand	1.1617274079423625
Marion	1.1617274079423625
O Boylan she said	126.99109556487812
He s bringing the programme	410.6204064167453

Doyle she said and s Old Sweet	1643.043796432458
Her full lips drinking smiled	410.6204064167453
Rather stale smell that incense leaves next day	2903.2601932065677
Like foul flowerwater	21.840993118326033
Would you like the window open a little	2422.259248059267
She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth asking What time is the funeral	1333.521432163324
Eleven I think he answered	368.9265519088789
I didn t see the paper	576.431963393246
Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed	428.1332398719392
No	1.1617274079423625
Then a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking rumpled shiny sole	7017.038286703832
No that book	21.840993118326033
Other stocking	1.1617274079423625
Her petticoat	1.1617274079423625
It must have fell down she said	1505.608178403045
He felt here and there	310.29263898985454
e non	1.1617274079423625
Wonder if she pronounces that right	949.4860105710369
Not in the bed	108.9829112695572
He stooped and lifted the valance	862.742811655988
The book fallen sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot	7719.846677868277
Show here she said	126.99109556487812
I put a mark in it	949.4860105710369
There s a word I wanted to ask you	2625.823845397989
She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word	26.826957952797255
Met him what	21.840993118326033
he asked	1.1617274079423625
Here she said	21.840993118326033
What does that mean	95.30337831672655
He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail	4293.13994636419
Metempsychosis	1.1617274079423625
Yes	1.1617274079423625
Who s he when he s at home	2414.681536312937
Metempsychosis he said frowning	97.11203420129426
It s Greek from the Greek	862.742811655988
That means the transmigration of souls	949.4860105710369
O rocks	1.1617274079423625
she said	1.1617274079423625
Tell us in plain words	410.6204064167453
He smiled glancing askance at her mocking eyes	2903.2601932065677
The same young eyes	126.99109556487812
The first night after the charades	862.742811655988
Dolphin s Barn	15.685352704529745
He turned over the smudged pages	862.742811655988
the Pride of the	126.99109556487812
Hello	1.1617274079423625

Families of them	21.840993118326033
Bone them young so they metamspychosis	949.4860105710369

Dignam s soul	21.840993118326033
Did you finish it	126.99109556487812
he asked	1.1617274079423625
Yes she said	21.840993118326033
There s nothing smutty in it	866.2253711860347
Is she in love with the first fellow all the time	5173.65654708398
Never read it	21.840993118326033
Do you want another	97.44303345634985
Yes	1.1617274079423625
Get another of Paul de Kock s	1618.137084703284
Nice name he has	111.05117566129712
She poured more tea into her cup watching it flow sideways	7719.846677868277
Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they ll write to Kearney my guarantor	873.3261623828432
Reincarnation that s the word	277.47874098898427
Some people believe he said that we go on living in another body after death that we lived before	316.227766016838
They call it reincarnation	126.99109556487812
That we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet	873.3261623828432
They say we have forgotten it	862.742811655988
Some say they remember their past lives	1780.428763062773
Better remind her of the word metempsychosis	1483.8382491323312
An example would be better	368.9265519088789
An example	1.1617274079423625
The of the over the bed	866.2253711860347
Given away with the Easter number of Splendid masterpiece in art colours	7017.038286703832
Tea before you put milk in	949.4860105710369
Not unlike her with her hair down slimmer	2475.298852735907
Three and six I gave for the frame	2694.78913506113
She said it would look nice over the bed	4026.008396445538
Naked nymphs Greece and for instance all the people that lived then	7017.038286703832
He turned the pages back	410.6204064167453
Metempsychosis he said is what the ancient Greeks called it	5247.276053407287
They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree for instance	873.3261623828432
What they called nymphs for example	949.4860105710369
Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar	2903.2601932065677
She gazed straight before her inhaling through her arched nostrils	5912.555183224002
There s a smell of burn she said	2048.1658444174845
Did you leave anything on the fire	1637.2623817614965
The kidney	1.1617274079423625
he cried suddenly	21.840993118326033
He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and stubbing his toes against the broken commode hurried out towards the smell stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork s legs	29.552092352028872
Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan	2154.4346900318833
By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back	240.40991835099712
Only a little burnt	126.99109556487812
He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it	316.227766016838
Cup of tea now	111.05117566129712
He sat down cut and buttered a slice of the loaf	6196.714068736458
He shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat	7017.038286703832
Then he put a forkful into his mouth chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat	1333.521432163324
Done to a turn	126.99109556487812
A mouthful of tea	126.99109556487812
Then he cut away dies of bread sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth	428.1332398719392
What was that about some young student and a picnic	5404.762704064018
He creased out the letter at his side reading it slowly as he chewed sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth	52.983169062837085

Poor papa	1.1617274079423625
How he used to talk of Kate Bateman in that	4991.2804500073835
Outside the Adelphi in London waited all the afternoon to get in	7017.038286703832
Year before I was born that was sixtyfive	2601.4832449920805
And Ristori in Vienna	126.99109556487812

Well perhaps it was best for him	1780.428763062773
Mr Bloom went round the corner and passed the drooping nags of the hazard	2154.4346900318833
No use thinking of it any more	1637.2623817614965
Nosebag time	1.1617274079423625
Wish I hadn t met that M Coy fellow	3401.155613381234
He came nearer and heard a crunching of gilded oats the gently champing teeth	2154.4346900318833
Their full buck eyes regarded him as he went by amid the sweet oaten reek of horsepiss	599.4842503189408
Their Eldorado	1.1617274079423625
Poor jugginses	1.1617274079423625
Damn all they know or care about anything with their long noses stuck in nosebags	1333.521432163324
Too full for words	97.11203420129426
Still they get their feed all right and their doss	5562.856855515288
Gelded too a stump of black guttapercha wagging limp between their haunches	7017.038286703832
Might be happy all the same that way	2256.3665051110165
Good poor brutes they look	410.6204064167453
Still their neigh can be very irritating	1780.428763062773
He drew the letter from his pocket and folded it into the newspaper he carried	1333.521432163324
Might just walk into her here	949.4860105710369
The lane is safer	126.99109556487812

All waited	1.1617274079423625
Then wheels were heard from in front turning then nearer then horses hoofs	3727.5937203149383
A jolt	1.1617274079423625
Their carriage began to move creaking and swaying	2903.2601932065677
Other hoofs and creaking wheels started behind	1780.428763062773
The blinds of the avenue passed and number nine with its craped knocker door ajar	1333.521432163324
At walking pace	21.840993118326033
They waited still their knees jogging till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks	873.3261623828432
Tritonville road	1.1617274079423625
Quicker	1.1617274079423625
The wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes	599.4842503189408
What way is he taking us	949.4860105710369
Irishtown Martin Cunningham said	70.62472901622768
Ringsend	1.1617274079423625
Mr Dedalus nodded looking out	367.1967010491309
That s a fine old custom he said	2242.7085843821023
I am glad to see it has not died out	5202.626635301336
All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers	7017.038286703832
Respect	1.1617274079423625
The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past Watery lane	3727.5937203149383
There s a friend of yours gone by Dedalus he said	5588.7638053053515
Who is that	18.60036465451084
Your son and heir	126.99109556487812
Where is he	15.685352704529745
Mr Dedalus said stretching over across	591.7242321853387
The carriage passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses lurched round the corner and swerving back to the tramtrack rolled on noisily with chattering wheels	36.51741272548377
Mr Dedalus fell back saying Was that Mulligan cad with him	7719.846677868277
His	1.1617274079423625
No Mr Bloom said	48.65390229573442
He was alone	21.840993118326033
Down with his aunt Sally I suppose Mr Dedalus said the Goulding faction the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie papa s little lump of dung the wise child that knows her own father	29.552092352028872
Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road	1637.2623817614965
Wallace Bros the bottleworks Dodder bridge	949.4860105710369
Richie Goulding and the legal bag	949.4860105710369
Goulding Collis and Ward he calls the firm	2203.238615095605
His jokes are getting a bit damp	1643.043796432458
Great card he was	126.99109556487812
Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning the landlady s two hats pinned on his head	240.40991835099712
Out on the rampage all night	949.4860105710369
Beginning to tell on him now that backache of his I fear	7017.038286703832
Wife ironing his back	126.99109556487812
Thinks he ll cure it with pills	1637.2623817614965
All breadcrumbs they are	126.99109556487812
About six hundred per cent profit	949.4860105710369
He s in with a lowdown crowd Mr Dedalus snarled	5145.150198027183
That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts	7719.846677868277
His name stinks all over Dublin	949.4860105710369
But with the help of God and His blessed mother I ll make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate	12.91549665014884
I ll tickle his catastrophe believe you me	2694.78913506113
He cried above the clatter of the wheels I won t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son	240.40991835099712
A counterjumper s son	126.99109556487812
Selling tapes in my cousin Peter Paul M Swiney s	5912.555183224002
Not likely	1.1617274079423625
He ceased	1.1617274079423625
Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power s mild face and Martin Cunningham s eyes and beard gravely shaking	149.24955450518294
Noisy selfwilled man	21.840993118326033
Full of his son	111.05117566129712
He is right	21.840993118326033
Something to hand on	126.99109556487812
If little Rudy had lived	410.6204064167453
See him grow up	126.99109556487812
Hear his voice in the house	634.5028688899017
Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit	1505.608178403045
My son	1.1617274079423625
Me in his eyes	89.02087655500138
Strange feeling it would be	305.4025733674428
From me	1.1617274079423625
Just a chance	21.840993118326033
Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil	52.983169062837085
And the sergeant grinning up	410.6204064167453
She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched	7017.038286703832
Give us a touch Poldy	329.2975248401484
God I m dying for it	949.4860105710369
How life begins	21.840993118326033
Got big then	21.840993118326033
Had to refuse the Greystones concert	949.4860105710369
My son inside her	126.99109556487812
I could have helped him on in life	2383.274512910454
I could	1.1617274079423625
Make him independent	21.840993118326033
Learn German too	21.840993118326033
Are we late	21.840993118326033
Mr Power asked	17.06185700055526
Ten minutes Martin Cunningham said looking at his watch	2799.733531292512
Molly	1.1617274079423625
Milly	1.1617274079423625
Same thing watered down	126.99109556487812
Her tomboy oaths	21.840993118326033
O jumping Jupiter	21.840993118326033
Ye gods and little fishes	410.6204064167453
Still she s a dear girl	729.9384922182104
Soon be a woman	111.05117566129712
Mullingar	1.1617274079423625
Dearest Papli	1.1617274079423625
Young student	1.1617274079423625
Yes yes a woman too	410.6204064167453
Life life	1.1617274079423625
The carriage heeled over and back their four trunks swaying	5912.555183224002
Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke Mr Power said	7017.038286703832
He might Mr Dedalus said if he hadn t that squint troubling him	3727.5937203149383
Do you follow me	95.30337831672655
He closed his left eye	311.4593559728013
Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs	7243.2890197195
What is this he said in the name of God	2668.6275871574253
Crumbs	1.1617274079423625
Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately Mr Power said	2154.4346900318833
All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats	1333.521432163324
Mr Dedalus twisting his nose frowned downward and said Unless I m greatly mistaken	2154.4346900318833
What do you think Martin	267.8553541643342
It struck me too Martin Cunningham said	1233.8555092857132
Mr Bloom set his thigh down	949.4860105710369
Feel my feet quite clean	410.6204064167453
But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better	5912.555183224002
Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly	111.05117566129712
After all he said it s the most natural thing in the world	3727.5937203149383
Did Tom Kernan turn up	410.6204064167453
Martin Cunningham asked twirling the peak of his beard gently	4355.293160473704
Yes Mr Bloom answered	76.39712255081238
He s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes	2694.78913506113
And Corny Kelleher himself	126.99109556487812
Mr Power asked	17.06185700055526
At the cemetery Martin Cunningham said	624.4199960297107
I met M Coy this morning Mr Bloom said	2612.2437522077626
He said he d try to come	1277.7037961367007
The carriage halted short	126.99109556487812
What s wrong	18.60036465451084
We re stopped	21.840993118326033
Where are we	18.60036465451084
Mr Bloom put his head out of the window	2211.505015616203
The grand canal he said	410.6204064167453
Gasworks	1.1617274079423625
Whooping cough they say it cures	949.4860105710369
Good job Milly never got it	949.4860105710369
Poor children	1.1617274079423625
Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions	2509.1370150228763
Shame really	1.1617274079423625
Got off lightly with illnesses compared	949.4860105710369
Only measles	1.1617274079423625
Flaxseed tea	1.1617274079423625
Scarlatina influenza epidemics	21.840993118326033
Canvassing for death	21.840993118326033
Don t miss this chance	410.6204064167453
Dogs home over there	126.99109556487812
Poor old Athos	21.840993118326033
Be good to Athos Leopold is my last wish	4014.671278934556
Thy will be done	111.05117566129712
A dying scrawl	21.840993118326033
He took it to heart pined away	1780.428763062773
Quiet brute	1.1617274079423625
Old men s dogs usually are	949.4860105710369
A raindrop spat on his hat	803.3290774201911
He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray dots over the grey flags	1333.521432163324
Apart	1.1617274079423625
Curious	1.1617274079423625
Like through a colander	126.99109556487812
I thought it would	85.21198574747604
The weather is changing he said quietly	1637.2623817614965
A pity it did not keep up fine Martin Cunningham said	5672.3403741494
Wanted for the country Mr Power said	1216.8519499711467
There s the sun again coming out	1618.1370847032842
Mr Dedalus peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun hurled a mute curse at the sky	599.4842503189408
It s as uncertain as a child s bottom he said	6919.7035378784885
We re off again	126.99109556487812
The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently	7017.038286703832
Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard	4962.303133233882
Tom Kernan was immense last night he said	2903.2601932065677
And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face	4014.671278934556
O draw him out Martin Mr Power said eagerly	3385.8725994702895
Wait till you hear him Simon on Ben Dollard s singing of Croppy	3727.5937203149383
Immense Martin Cunningham said pompously	251.8218821801802
singing of that simple ballad Martin is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my experience Trenchant Mr Power said laughing	71.09709432312432
He s dead nuts on that	715.1818065827027
And the retrospective arrangement	126.99109556487812
Did you read Dan Dawson s speech	1510.9247026866935
Martin Cunningham asked	18.040717293319346
I did not then Mr Dedalus said	915.3929919499353
Where is it	21.840993118326033
In the paper this morning	410.6204064167453
Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket	3510.749816246407
That book I must change for her	1780.428763062773
Later on please	21.840993118326033
Mr Bloom s glance travelled down the edge of the paper scanning the deaths Callan Coleman Dignam Fawcett Lowry Naumann Peake what Peake is that	83.76776400682921
is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne s	5577.135999216109
no Sexton Urbright	21.840993118326033
Inked characters fast fading on the frayed breaking paper	4293.13994636419
Thanks to the Little Flower	367.1967010491309
Sadly missed	1.1617274079423625
To the inexpressible grief of his	949.4860105710369
Aged after a long and tedious illness	1780.428763062773
Month s mind Quinlan	126.99109556487812
On whose soul Sweet Jesus have mercy	1637.2623817614965
Yes	1.1617274079423625
Where did I put her letter after I read it in the bath	3727.5937203149383
He patted his waistcoatpocket	126.99109556487812
There all right	21.840993118326033
Dear Henry fled	21.840993118326033
Before my patience are exhausted	328.36511569890223
National school	1.1617274079423625
Meade s yard	21.840993118326033
The hazard	1.1617274079423625
Nodding	1.1617274079423625
Full as a tick	126.99109556487812
Too much bone in their skulls	949.4860105710369
The other trotting round with a fare	1780.428763062773
An hour ago I was passing there	1389.4294614335427
The jarvies raised their hats	410.6204064167453
A pointsman s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway standard by Mr Bloom s window	599.4842503189408
Couldn t they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier	3727.5937203149383
Well but that fellow would lose his job then	4014.671278934556
Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention	3727.5937203149383
Antient concert rooms	21.840993118326033
Nothing on there	21.840993118326033
A man in a buff suit with a crape armlet	5202.626635301336
Not much grief there	126.99109556487812
Quarter mourning	1.1617274079423625
People in law perhaps	126.99109556487812
They went past the bleak pulpit of saint Mark s under the railway bridge past the Queen s theatre in silence	187.38174228603845
Hoardings Eugene Stratton Mrs Bandmann Palmer	824.5274024412339
Could I go to see tonight I wonder	2703.245875619065

Or the of	21.840993118326033
Elster Grimes Opera Company	126.99109556487812
Big powerful change	21.840993118326033
Wet bright bills for next week	949.4860105710369
on the	1.1617274079423625
Martin Cunningham could work a pass for the Gaiety	3754.265101828748
Have to stand a drink or two	1780.428763062773
As broad as it s long	783.9243030199358
He s coming in the afternoon	949.4860105710369
Her songs	1.1617274079423625
Plasto s	1.1617274079423625
Sir Philip Crampton s memorial fountain bust	1637.2623817614965
Who was he	21.840993118326033
How do you do	61.5146937603997
Martin Cunningham said raising his palm to his brow in salute	5730.398648519225
He doesn t see us Mr Power said	1639.1510334317638
Yes he does	21.840993118326033
How do you do	61.5146937603997
Who	1.1617274079423625
Mr Dedalus asked	16.30162829280214
Blazes Boylan Mr Power said	276.43931432444447
There he is airing his quiff	711.7465568061971
Just that moment I was thinking	785.8319097631646
Mr Dedalus bent across to salute	862.742811655988
From the door of the Red Bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply spruce figure passed	316.227766016838
Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand then those of his right hand	1333.521432163324
The nails yes	21.840993118326033
Is there anything more in him that they she sees	5912.555183224002
Fascination	1.1617274079423625
Worst man in Dublin	111.05117566129712
That keeps him alive	126.99109556487812
They sometimes feel what a person is	1780.428763062773
Instinct	1.1617274079423625
But a type like that	410.6204064167453
My nails	1.1617274079423625
I am just looking at them well pared	2509.1370150228763
And after thinking alone	126.99109556487812
Body getting a bit softy	368.9265519088789
I would notice that from remembering	949.4860105710369
What causes that	21.840993118326033
I suppose the skin can t contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off	2154.4346900318833
But the shape is there	367.1967010491309
The shape is there still	367.1967010491309
Shoulders	1.1617274079423625
Hips	1.1617274079423625
Plump	1.1617274079423625
Night of the dance dressing	410.6204064167453
Shift stuck between the cheeks behind	949.4860105710369
He clasped his hands between his knees and satisfied sent his vacant glance over their faces	873.3261623828432
Mr Power asked How is the concert tour getting on Bloom	6723.402346190046
O very well Mr Bloom said	565.5519668436837
I hear great accounts of it	949.4860105710369
It s a good idea you see	960.864313081016
Are you going yourself	100.49400469796984
Well no Mr Bloom said	201.5678131190469
In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business	599.4842503189408
You see the idea is to tour the chief towns	5562.856855515288
What you lose on one you can make up on the other	7017.038286703832
Quite so Martin Cunningham said	251.8218821801802
Mary Anderson is up there now	949.4860105710369
Have you good artists	126.99109556487812
Louis Werner is touring her Mr Bloom said	1940.3205066244702
O yes we ll have all topnobbers	1780.428763062773
J	1.1617274079423625
C	1.1617274079423625
Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and	1637.2623817614965
The best in fact	126.99109556487812
And Mr Power said smiling	276.43931432444447
Last but not least	111.05117566129712
Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them	2154.4346900318833
Smith O Brien	18.469695921350887
Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there	2373.682929071753
Woman	1.1617274079423625
Must be his deathday	126.99109556487812
For many happy returns	126.99109556487812
The carriage wheeling by Farrell s statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees	7017.038286703832
Oot a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares his mouth opening oot	1333.521432163324
Four bootlaces for a penny	337.8673804303916
Wonder why he was struck off the rolls	2903.2601932065677
Had his office in Hume street	949.4860105710369
Same house as Molly s namesake Tweedy crown solicitor for Waterford	7719.846677868277
Has that silk hat ever since	949.4860105710369
Relics of old decency	126.99109556487812
Mourning too	1.1617274079423625
Terrible comedown poor wretch	126.99109556487812
Kicked about like snuff at a wake	1273.2079114328556
And	1.1617274079423625
Twenty past eleven	21.840993118326033
Up	1.1617274079423625
Mrs Fleming is in to clean	949.4860105710369
Doing her hair humming e non	949.4860105710369
No e	1.1617274079423625
trema un poco	18.469695921350887
Beautiful on that her voice is weeping tone	2903.2601932065677
A thrush	1.1617274079423625
A throstle	1.1617274079423625
There is a word throstle that expresses that	2601.4832449920805
His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power s goodlooking face	5241.94263730665
Greyish over the ears	111.05117566129712
smiling	1.1617274079423625
I smiled back	21.840993118326033
A smile goes a long way	851.2348218321658
Only politeness perhaps	21.840993118326033
Nice fellow	1.1617274079423625
Who knows is that true about the woman he keeps	5562.856855515288
Not pleasant for the wife	361.48876812228025
Yet they say who was it told me there is no carnal	7017.038286703832
You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick	5912.555183224002
Yes it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak	2154.4346900318833
What is this she was	278.52207595359204
Barmaid in Jury s	126.99109556487812
Or the Moira was it	410.6204064167453
They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator s form	2694.78913506113
Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power	410.6204064167453
Of the tribe of Reuben he said	1396.4644719380128
A tall blackbearded figure bent on a stick stumping round the corner of Elvery s Elephant house showed them a curved hand open on his spine	71.09709432312432
In all his pristine beauty Mr Power said	2230.1058582625474
Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly The devil break the hasp of your back	428.1332398719392
Mr Power collapsing in laughter shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray s statue	428.1332398719392
We have all been there Martin Cunningham said broadly	3201.5980588350685
His eyes met Mr Bloom s eyes	1261.406557768583
Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions faces	7017.038286703832
That s an awfully good one that s going the rounds about Reuben J and the son	599.4842503189408
About the boatman	21.840993118326033
Mr Power asked	17.06185700055526
Yes	1.1617274079423625
Isn t it awfully good	293.6400269933979
What is that	15.685352704529745
Mr Dedalus asked	16.30162829280214
I didn t hear it	231.92064725227257
There was a girl in the case Mr Bloom began and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harm s way but when they were both	36.51741272548377
What	1.1617274079423625
Mr Dedalus asked	16.30162829280214
That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it	949.4860105710369
Yes Mr Bloom said	43.099218139479426
They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown	2154.4346900318833
I wish to Christ he did	949.4860105710369
Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils	5912.555183224002
No Mr Bloom said the son himself	977.4957036392584
Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey	12.216773489967919
For God s sake	126.99109556487812
Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright	410.6204064167453
Is he dead	21.840993118326033
Dead	1.1617274079423625
Martin Cunningham cried	21.840993118326033
A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive	41.011270705513006
Half the town was there	410.6204064167453
Yes Mr Bloom said	43.099218139479426
But the funny part is	410.6204064167453
And Reuben J Martin Cunningham said gave the boatman a florin for saving his son s life	599.4842503189408
A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power s hand	5241.94263730665
O he did Martin Cunningham affirmed	862.742811655988
Like a hero	21.840993118326033
A silver florin	21.840993118326033
Isn t it awfully good	293.6400269933979
Mr Bloom said eagerly	61.48239762771313
One and eightpence too much Mr Dedalus said drily	2397.194630432445
Mr Power s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage	4640.209825509239
Nelson s pillar	17.06185700055526
Eight plums a penny	126.99109556487812
Eight for a penny	100.49400469796984
We had better look a little serious Martin Cunningham said	4260.614235356942
Mr Dedalus sighed	18.469695921350887
Ah then indeed he said poor little Paddy wouldn t grudge us a laugh	2154.4346900318833
Many a good one he told himself	1447.0889968106228
The Lord forgive me	126.99109556487812
Mr Power said wiping his wet eyes with his fingers	4444.831783972623
I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he was in his usual health that I d be driving after him like this	61.05402296585327
He s gone from us	337.8673804303916
As decent a little man as ever wore a hat Mr Dedalus said	3727.5937203149383
He went very suddenly	126.99109556487812
Breakdown Martin Cunningham said	70.62472901622768
He tapped his chest sadly	367.1967010491309
Blazing face redhot	21.840993118326033
Too much John Barleycorn	126.99109556487812
Cure for a red nose	367.1967010491309
Drink like the devil till it turns adelite	2903.2601932065677
Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension	5577.135999216109
He had a sudden death poor fellow he said	3571.3583767964046
The best death Mr Bloom said	565.5519668436837
Their wide open eyes looked at him	1637.2623817614965
No suffering he said	126.99109556487812
A moment and all is over	949.4860105710369
Like dying in sleep	126.99109556487812
No one spoke	21.840993118326033
Dead side of the street this	640.3799021635949
Dull business by day land agents temperance hotel Falconer s railway guide civil service college Gill s catholic club the industrious blind	149.24955450518294
Why	1.1617274079423625
Some reason	1.1617274079423625
Sun or wind	21.840993118326033
At night too	21.840993118326033
Chummies and slaveys	21.840993118326033

White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner galloping	7017.038286703832
A tiny coffin flashed by	410.6204064167453
In a hurry to bury	410.6204064167453

Dun for a nun	126.99109556487812
Sad Martin Cunningham said	70.62472901622768
A child	1.1617274079423625
A dwarf s face mauve and wrinkled like little Rudy s was	7017.038286703832

Mistake of nature	21.840993118326033
If it s healthy it s from the mother	4014.671278934556
If not from the man	410.6204064167453
Better luck next time	126.99109556487812
Poor little thing Mr Dedalus said	591.7242321853387
It s well out of it	591.9863334588213
The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square	5912.555183224002
Rattle his bones	18.469695921350887
Over the stones	18.469695921350887
Only a pauper	21.840993118326033
Nobody owns	1.1617274079423625
In the midst of life Martin Cunningham said	1686.394814827167
But the worst of all Mr Power said is the man who takes his own life	873.3261623828432
Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly coughed and put it back	7017.038286703832
The greatest disgrace to have in the family Mr Power added	6528.238891300286
Temporary insanity of course Martin Cunningham said decisively	2095.6620597522124
We must take a charitable view of it	2903.2601932065677
They say a man who does it is a coward Mr Dedalus said	3727.5937203149383
It is not for us to judge Martin Cunningham said	3749.036485360152
Mr Bloom about to speak closed his lips again	4014.671278934556
Martin Cunningham s large eyes	329.912032313567
Looking away now	21.840993118326033
Sympathetic human man he is	367.1967010491309
Intelligent	1.1617274079423625
Like Shakespeare s face	126.99109556487812
Always a good word to say	787.0887026711796
They have no mercy on that here or infanticide	4014.671278934556
Refuse christian burial	21.840993118326033
They used to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave	2154.4346900318833
As if it wasn t broken already	1538.1684667290513
Yet sometimes they repent too late	949.4860105710369
Found in the riverbed clutching rushes	949.4860105710369
He looked at me	95.30337831672657
And that awful drunkard of a wife of his	4026.008396445538
Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost	428.1332398719392
Leading him the life of the damned	1488.020769087348
Wear the heart out of a stone that	2469.1133923535576
Monday morning	1.1617274079423625
Start afresh	1.1617274079423625
Shoulder to the wheel	111.05117566129712
Lord she must have looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there	873.3261623828432
Drunk about the place and capering with Martin s umbrella	5085.097784126136
And they call me the jewel of Asia Of Asia The geisha	7017.038286703832
He looked away from me	410.6204064167453
He knows	1.1617274079423625
Rattle his bones	18.469695921350887
That afternoon of the inquest	410.6204064167453
The redlabelled bottle on the table	719.321741022154
The room in the hotel with hunting pictures	2475.298852735907
Stuffy it was	21.840993118326033
Sunlight through the slats of the Venetian blind	2903.2601932065677
The coroner s sunlit ears big and hairy	2903.2601932065677
Boots giving evidence	21.840993118326033
Thought he was asleep first	410.6204064167453
Then saw like yellow streaks on his face	2666.78996584088
Had slipped down to the foot of the bed	2152.4590020979736

Wake no more	21.840993118326033
Nobody owns	1.1617274079423625
The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street	1780.428763062773
Over the stones	18.469695921350887
God grant he doesn t upset us on the road Mr Power said	3727.5937203149383
That will be a great race tomorrow in Germany	3349.1381579292006
The Gordon Bennett	21.840993118326033
Yes by Jove Mr Dedalus said	591.7242321853387
That will be worth seeing faith	866.2253711860347
As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls	121.15276586285881

He s gone over to the lying in hospital they told me	6910.0049576145175
From one extreme to the other	803.3290774201911
The carriage galloped round a corner stopped	1780.428763062773
What s wrong now	111.6792609014905
A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows lowing slouching by on padded hoofs whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups	100.00000000000001
Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear	7719.846677868277
Emigrants Mr Power said	78.9885977765658
Huuuh	1.1617274079423625

Wonder if that dodge works now getting dicky meat off the train at Clonsilla	2154.4346900318833
I can t make out why the corporation doesn t run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays Mr Bloom said	149.24955450518294
All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats	7017.038286703832
Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare Martin Cunningham said	3201.5980588350685
Quite right	1.1617274079423625
Yes Mr Bloom said and another thing I often thought is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan you know	121.15276586285881
Run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams hearse and carriage and all	599.4842503189408
Don t you see what I mean	1050.949641382832
O that be damned for a story Mr Dedalus said	4376.084569541338

A poor lookout for Corny Mr Power added	2694.78913506113
Why	1.1617274079423625
Mr Bloom asked turning to Mr Dedalus	1462.1519118532806
Wouldn t it be more decent than galloping two abreast	5562.856855515288
Well there s something in that Mr Dedalus granted	3889.346285241056
And Martin Cunningham said we wouldn t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy s and upset the coffin on to the road	71.09709432312432
That was terrible Mr Power s shocked face said and the corpse fell about the road	873.3261623828432
Terrible	1.1617274079423625

Quite right to close it	410.6204064167453
Looks horrid open	21.840993118326033

I wonder how is our friend Fogarty getting on Mr Power said	7017.038286703832
Better ask Tom Kernan Mr Dedalus said	1177.135718989578
How is that	17.06185700055526
Martin Cunningham said	10.489427551289968

Gloomy gardens then went by one by one gloomy houses	5315.9187681762505
Mr Power pointed	21.840993118326033
That is where Childs was murdered he said	2903.2601932065677
The last house	21.840993118326033
So it is Mr Dedalus said	488.54538258749153
A gruesome case	21.840993118326033
Seymour Bushe got him off	410.6204064167453
Murdered his brother	21.840993118326033
Or so they said	111.05117566129712
The crown had no evidence Mr Power said	2230.1058582625474
That s the maxim of the law	1117.4438432039824
Better for ninetynine guilty to escape than for one innocent person to be wrongfully condemned	1333.521432163324
They looked	1.1617274079423625

Corny Kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took out the two wreaths	3727.5937203149383
He handed one to the boy	787.0887026711796

A team of horses passed from Finglas with toiling plodding tread dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a granite block	83.76776400682921
The waggoner marching at their head saluted	1637.2623817614965
Coffin now	1.1617274079423625
Got here before us dead as he is	2666.78996584088

Mourners came out through the gates woman and a girl	4324.1589734552435
Leanjawed harpy hard woman at a bargain her bonnet awry	5233.841450267788
Girl s face stained with dirt and tears holding the woman s arm looking up at her for a sign to cry	149.24955450518294
Fish s face bloodless and livid	949.4860105710369
The mutes shouldered the coffin and bore it in through the gates	7017.038286703832
So much dead weight	126.99109556487812
Felt heavier myself stepping out of that bath	2286.089651750046
First the stiff then the friends of the stiff	3754.265101828748
Corny Kelleher and the boy followed with their wreaths	4293.13994636419
Who is that beside them	368.9265519088789
Ah the brother in law	289.89634889058163
All walked after	21.840993118326033
Martin Cunningham whispered I was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before Bloom	1333.521432163324
What	1.1617274079423625
Mr Power whispered	18.469695921350887
How so	1.1617274079423625
His father poisoned himself Martin Cunningham whispered	1505.608178403045
Had the Queen s hotel in Ennis	1508.8134788406453
You heard him say he was going to Clare	2880.1824595142
Anniversary	1.1617274079423625
O God	1.1617274079423625
First I heard of it	367.1967010491309
He glanced behind him to where a face with dark thinking eyes followed towards the cardinal s mausoleum	428.1332398719392
Speaking	1.1617274079423625
Was he insured	21.840993118326033
Mr Bloom asked	14.730183987478947
I believe so Mr Kernan answered	949.4860105710369
But the policy was heavily mortgaged	949.4860105710369
Martin is trying to get the youngster into Artane	3459.872171587589
How many children did he leave	862.742811655988
Five	1.1617274079423625
Ned Lambert says he ll try to get one of the girls into Todd s	1333.521432163324
A sad case Mr Bloom said gently	1040.4692194122035
Five young children	21.840993118326033
A great blow to the poor wife Mr Kernan added	5233.841450267788
Indeed yes Mr Bloom agreed	368.9265519088789
Has the laugh at him now	862.742811655988
He looked down at the boots he had blacked and polished	6723.402346190046
She had outlived him	126.99109556487812
Lost her husband	21.840993118326033
More dead for her than for me	1780.428763062773
One must outlive the other	410.6204064167453
Wise men say	21.840993118326033
There are more women than men in the world	2776.643570076294
Condole with her	21.840993118326033
Your terrible loss	21.840993118326033
I hope you ll soon follow him	1387.4880035924175
For Hindu widows only	126.99109556487812
She would marry another	126.99109556487812

No	1.1617274079423625

Vain in her heart of hearts	866.2253711860347
All for a shadow	111.05117566129712
Her son was the substance	410.6204064167453
Something new to hope for not like the past she wanted back waiting	3727.5937203149383
One must go first alone under the ground and lie no more in her warm bed	873.3261623828432
How are you Simon	100.49400469796984
Ned Lambert said softly clasping hands	736.6947379291765
Haven t seen you for a month of Sundays	3510.749816246407
Never better	1.1617274079423625
How are all in Cork s own town	2501.287517886216
I was down there for the Cork park races on Easter Monday Ned Lambert said	1333.521432163324
Same old six and eightpence	410.6204064167453
Stopped with Dick Tivy	126.99109556487812
And how is Dick the solid man	1637.2623817614965
Nothing between himself and heaven Ned Lambert answered	2509.1370150228763
By the holy Paul	126.99109556487812
Mr Dedalus said in subdued wonder	591.7242321853387
Dick Tivy bald	21.840993118326033
Martin is going to get up a whip for the youngsters Ned Lambert said pointing ahead	873.3261623828432
A few bob a skull	328.36511569890223
Just to keep them going till the insurance is cleared up	7243.2890197195
Is that the eldest boy in front	1637.2623817614965
Yes Ned Lambert said with the wife s brother	2939.4033173966914
John Henry Menton is behind	281.3364839629534
He put down his name for a quid	2703.245875619065
I ll engage he did Mr Dedalus said	1865.4910748652478
I often told poor Paddy he ought to mind that job	7002.635853824429
John Henry is not the worst in the world	3175.193840654243
How did he lose it	367.1967010491309
Ned Lambert asked	18.040717293319346
Liquor what	1.1617274079423625
Many a good man s fault Mr Dedalus said with a sigh	5742.833018868659
They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel	2742.83723459162
Mr Bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar	83.76776400682921
Poor boy	1.1617274079423625
Was he there when the father	949.4860105710369
Both unconscious	1.1617274079423625
Lighten up at the last moment and recognise for the last time	6331.689524049474
All he might have done	348.29171113587296
I owe three shillings to O Grady	1780.428763062773
Would he understand	21.840993118326033
The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel	2694.78913506113
Which end is his head	410.6204064167453
After a moment he followed the others in blinking in the screened light	3727.5937203149383
The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel four tall yellow candles at its corners	873.3261623828432
Always in front of us	286.9138253959981
Corny Kelleher laying a wreath at each fore corner beckoned to the boy to kneel	1333.521432163324
The mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks	2235.692572699173
Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and when all had knelt dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it	61.05402296585327
He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and holding its brim bent over piously	599.4842503189408
A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door	1333.521432163324
The whitesmocked priest came after him tidying his stole with one hand balancing with the other a little book against his toad s belly	100.00000000000001
Who ll read the book	367.1967010491309
I said the rook	126.99109556487812
They halted by the bier and the priest began to read out of his book with a fluent croak	316.227766016838
Father Coffey	1.1617274079423625
I knew his name was like a coffin	2336.2750273279153
Bully about the muzzle he looks	949.4860105710369
Bosses the show	21.840993118326033
Muscular christian	1.1617274079423625
Woe betide anyone that looks crooked at him priest	4293.13994636419
Thou art Peter	21.840993118326033
Burst sideways like a sheep in clover Dedalus says he will	7719.846677868277
With a belly on him like a poisoned pup	3339.707086476275
Most amusing expressions that man finds	949.4860105710369
Hhhn burst sideways	21.840993118326033
Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo Domine Makes them feel more important to be prayed over in Latin	316.227766016838

Crape weepers	1.1617274079423625

Your name on the altarlist	367.1967010491309
Chilly place this	21.840993118326033
Want to feed well sitting in there all the morning in the gloom kicking his heels waiting for the next please	187.38174228603845
Eyes of a toad too	410.6204064167453
What swells him up that way	862.742811655988
Molly gets swelled after cabbage	410.6204064167453
Air of the place maybe	361.48876812228025
Looks full up of bad gas	783.9243030199358
Must be an infernal lot of bad gas round the place	6903.461660503397
Butchers for instance they get like raw beefsteaks	2903.2601932065677
Who was telling me	81.0348424650412
Mervyn Browne	1.1617274079423625
Down in the vaults of saint Werburgh s lovely old organ hundred and fifty they have to bore a hole in the coffins sometimes to let out the bad gas and burn it	29.552092352028872
Out it rushes blue	126.99109556487812
One whiff of that and you re a goner	3647.3399415562467
My kneecap is hurting me	410.6204064167453
Ow	1.1617274079423625
The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy s bucket and shook it over the coffin	83.76776400682921
Then he walked to the other end and shook it again	6637.602416935541
Then he came back and put it back in the bucket	4517.599508448709
As you were before you rested	949.4860105710369
It s all written down he has to do it	4248.256641523996
Et ne nos inducas in tentationem The server piped the answers in the treble	2154.4346900318833
I often thought it would be better to have boy servants	5349.120525139328
Up to fifteen or so	410.6204064167453
After that of course	104.22607962703682
Holy water that was I expect	866.2253711860347
Shaking sleep out of it	264.61182517221647
He must be fed up with that job shaking that thing over all the corpses they trot up	428.1332398719392
What harm if he could see what he was shaking it over	6573.955139008795
Every mortal day a fresh batch middleaged men old women children women dead in childbirth men with beards baldheaded businessmen consumptive girls with little sparrows breasts	71.09709432312432
All the year round he prayed the same thing over them all and shook water on top of them sleep	240.40991835099712
On Dignam now	21.840993118326033
In paradisum Said he was going to paradise or is in paradise	7017.038286703832
Says that over everybody	126.99109556487812
Tiresome kind of a job	250.50241890446722
But he has to say something	824.5274024412339
Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in hoisted the coffin again carried it out and shoved it on their cart	121.15276586285881
Corny Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother in law	1333.521432163324
All followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air	6645.98120369032
Mr Bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket	6849.595667344243
He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left	2154.4346900318833
The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres	71.09709432312432
The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo	4633.03858951965
Lord I mustn t lilt here	862.742811655988
The O Connell circle Mr Dedalus said about him	3083.305764005942
Mr Power s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone	2154.4346900318833
He s at rest he said in the middle of his people old Dan O	1333.521432163324
But his heart is buried in Rome	1780.428763062773
How many broken hearts are buried here Simon	2903.2601932065677
Her grave is over there Jack Mr Dedalus said	3083.305764005942
I ll soon be stretched beside her	1780.428763062773
Let Him take me whenever He likes	1780.428763062773
Breaking down he began to weep to himself quietly stumbling a little in his walk	1333.521432163324
Mr Power took his arm	410.6204064167453
She s better where she is he said kindly	3301.598036740238
I suppose so Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp	3401.6488023092184
I suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven	6262.096924532765
Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by	2154.4346900318833
Sad occasions Mr Kernan began politely	949.4860105710369
Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head	6262.096924532765
The others are putting on their hats Mr Kernan said	5515.522139545052
I suppose we can do so too	1637.2623817614965
We are the last	91.14362409163705
This cemetery is a treacherous place	949.4860105710369
They covered their heads	126.99109556487812
The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly don t you think	7017.038286703832
Mr Kernan said with reproof	323.2608049832237
Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes	5912.555183224002
Secret eyes secretsearching	21.840993118326033
Mason I think not sure	410.6204064167453
Beside him again	21.840993118326033
We are the last	91.14362409163705
In the same boat	111.05117566129712
Hope he ll say something else	949.4860105710369
Mr Kernan added The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler more impressive I must say	240.40991835099712
Mr Bloom gave prudent assent	410.6204064167453
The language of course was another thing	1780.428763062773
Mr Kernan said with solemnity am the resurrection and the	4882.384603483692
That touches a man s inmost heart	1462.1519118532806
It does Mr Bloom said	224.34779203401013
Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies	240.40991835099712
No touching that	21.840993118326033
Seat of the affections	126.99109556487812
Broken heart	1.1617274079423625
A pump after all pumping thousands of gallons of blood every day	7017.038286703832
One fine day it gets bunged up and there you are	6849.595667344243
Lots of them lying around here lungs hearts livers	4014.671278934556
Old rusty pumps damn the thing else	1505.608178403045
The resurrection and the life	367.1967010491309
Once you are dead you are dead	1505.608178403045
That last day idea	126.99109556487812
Knocking them all up out of their graves	2284.326566294952
Come forth Lazarus	21.840993118326033
And he came fifth and lost the job	2694.78913506113
Get up	1.1617274079423625
Last day	1.1617274079423625
Then every fellow mousing around for his liver and his lights and the rest of his traps	599.4842503189408
Find damn all of himself that morning	1780.428763062773
Pennyweight of powder in a skull	949.4860105710369
Twelve grammes one pennyweight	126.99109556487812
Troy measure	1.1617274079423625
Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side	2903.2601932065677
Everything went off A he said	949.4860105710369
What	1.1617274079423625
He looked on them from his drawling eye	2694.78913506113
Policeman s shoulders	21.840993118326033
With your tooraloom tooraloom	126.99109556487812
As it should be Mr Kernan said	1470.6388029745208
What	1.1617274079423625
Eh	1.1617274079423625
Corny Kelleher said	18.60036465451084
Mr Kernan assured him	126.99109556487812
Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan	2703.245875619065
John Henry Menton asked	80.67071427878827
I know his face	97.11203420129426
Ned Lambert glanced back	126.99109556487812
Bloom he said Madame Marion Tweedy that was is I mean the soprano	3727.5937203149383
She s his wife	126.99109556487812
O to be sure John Henry Menton said	1807.7863280486972
I haven t seen her for some time	2080.3553193691055
She was a finelooking woman	361.48876812228025
I danced with her wait fifteen seventeen golden years ago at Mat Dillon s in Roundtown	873.3261623828432
And a good armful she was	949.4860105710369
He looked behind through the others	949.4860105710369
What is he	18.040717293319346
he asked	1.1617274079423625
What does he do	126.99109556487812
Wasn t he in the stationery line	1505.608178403045
I fell foul of him one evening I remember at bowls	7300.251061821653
Ned Lambert smiled	21.840993118326033
Yes he was he said in Wisdom Hely s	2796.5627399364475
A traveller for blottingpaper	126.99109556487812
In God s name John Henry Menton said what did she marry a coon like that for	599.4842503189408
She had plenty of game in her then	2903.2601932065677
Has still Ned Lambert said	305.4025733674428
He does some canvassing for ads	949.4860105710369
John Henry Menton s large eyes stared ahead	1950.0603944074523
The barrow turned into a side lane	1780.428763062773
A portly man ambushed among the grasses raised his hat in homage	7017.038286703832
The gravediggers touched their caps	410.6204064167453
John O Connell Mr Power said pleased	1221.1488334727285
He never forgets a friend	410.6204064167453
Mr O Connell shook all their hands in silence	4293.13994636419
Mr Dedalus said I am come to pay you another visit	5062.772480893617
My dear Simon the caretaker answered in a low voice	5247.276053407287
I don t want your custom at all	1515.5427458106926
Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham s side puzzling two long keys at his back	149.24955450518294
Did you hear that one he asked them about Mulcahy from the Coombe	3727.5937203149383
I did not Martin Cunningham said	515.5399918793007
They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear	7017.038286703832
The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles	149.24955450518294
They tell the story he said that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs	83.76776400682921
They asked for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried	2154.4346900318833
After traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough	7017.038286703832
One of the drunks spelt out the name Terence Mulcahy	5241.94263730665
The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up	428.1332398719392
The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed	6390.008538829641
He resumed And after blinking up at the sacred figure a bloody bit like the says he	599.4842503189408
s not says he done	410.6204064167453
Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher accepting the dockets given him turning them over and scanning them as he walked	83.76776400682921
That s all done with a purpose Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes	7017.038286703832
I know Hynes said	126.99109556487812
I know that	18.60036465451084
To cheer a fellow up Martin Cunningham said	1951.2856040159438
It s pure goodheartedness damn the thing else	2501.287517886216
Mr Bloom admired the caretaker s prosperous bulk	2903.2601932065677
All want to be on good terms with him	3581.443613364594
Decent fellow John O Connell real good sort	2703.245875619065
Keys like Keyes s ad no fear of anyone getting out	7300.251061821653
No passout checks	21.840993118326033
	1.1617274079423625
I must see about that ad after the funeral	4014.671278934556
Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writing to Martha	428.1332398719392
Hope it s not chucked in the dead letter office	4652.120652018232
Be the better of a shave	862.742811655988
Grey sprouting beard	21.840993118326033
That s the first sign when the hairs come out grey	6042.693406641836
And temper getting cross	126.99109556487812
Silver threads among the grey	410.6204064167453
Fancy being his wife	126.99109556487812
Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl	4820.506993370702
Come out and live in the graveyard	1780.428763062773
It might thrill her first	410.6204064167453
Courting death	1.1617274079423625
Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about	6836.7544450426
The shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O Connell must be a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark	14.547578108480476
Will o the wisp	126.99109556487812
Gas of graves	21.840993118326033
Women especially are so touchy	410.6204064167453
Tell her a ghost story in bed to make her sleep	6849.595667344242
Have you ever seen a ghost	949.4860105710369
Well I have	21.840993118326033
It was a pitchdark night	297.0167312896878
The clock was on the stroke of twelve	2437.01061835555
Still they d kiss all right if properly keyed up	5912.555183224002
Whores in Turkish graveyards	126.99109556487812
Learn anything if taken young	410.6204064167453
You might pick up a young widow here	2694.78913506113
Men like that	21.840993118326033
Love among the tombstones	126.99109556487812
Romeo	1.1617274079423625
Spice of pleasure	21.840993118326033
In the midst of death we are in life	3764.8668526744877
Both ends meet	21.840993118326033
Smell of grilled beefsteaks to the starving	1780.428763062773
Gnawing their vitals	21.840993118326033
Desire to grig people	126.99109556487812
Molly wanting to do it at the window	2062.6356098168135
Eight children he has anyway	410.6204064167453
He has seen a fair share go under in his time lying around him field after field	599.4842503189408
Holy fields	1.1617274079423625
More room if they buried them standing	1780.428763062773
Sitting or kneeling you couldn t	785.8319097631646
Standing	1.1617274079423625
His head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing	873.3261623828432
All honeycombed the ground must be oblong cells	2903.2601932065677
And very neat he keeps it too trim grass and edgings	7719.846677868277
His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome	1780.428763062773
Well so it is	111.6792609014905
Ought to be flowers of sleep	824.5274024412339
Chinese cemeteries with giant poppies growing produce the best opium Mastiansky told me	3727.5937203149383
The Botanic Gardens are just over there	1780.428763062773
It s the blood sinking in the earth gives new life	5293.073458605613
Same idea those jews they said killed the christian boy	5912.555183224002
Every man his price	126.99109556487812
Well preserved fat corpse gentleman epicure invaluable for fruit garden	5912.555183224002
A bargain	1.1617274079423625
By carcass of William Wilkinson auditor and accountant lately deceased three pounds thirteen and six	1333.521432163324
With thanks	1.1617274079423625
I daresay the soil would be quite fat with corpsemanure bones flesh nails	3727.5937203149383
Charnelhouses	1.1617274079423625
Dreadful	1.1617274079423625
Turning green and pink decomposing	410.6204064167453
The lean old ones tougher	410.6204064167453
Then begin to get black black treacle oozing out of them	7002.635853824429
Then dried up	21.840993118326033
Deathmoths	1.1617274079423625
Changing about	1.1617274079423625
Live for ever practically	126.99109556487812
Nothing to feed on feed on themselves	1780.428763062773
But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots	6042.693406641836
Soil must be simply swirling with them	1780.428763062773
Your head it simply swurls	256.2755164346742
Those pretty little seaside gurls	410.6204064167453
He looks cheerful enough over it	949.4860105710369
Gives him a sense of power seeing all the others go under first	3727.5937203149383
Wonder how he looks at life	949.4860105710369
Cracking his jokes too warms the cockles of his heart	5577.135999216109
The one about the bulletin	329.912032313567
Spurgeon went to heaven a m	949.4860105710369

Not arrived yet	21.840993118326033
Peter	1.1617274079423625
The dead themselves the men anyhow would like to hear an odd joke or the women to know what s in fashion	149.24955450518294
A juicy pear or ladies punch hot strong and sweet	5912.555183224002
Keep out the damp	126.99109556487812
You must laugh sometimes so better do it that way	5562.856855515288
Gravediggers in	1.1617274079423625
Shows the profound knowledge of the human heart	2469.1133923535576
Daren t joke about the dead for two years at least	7719.846677868277
mortuis nil nisi	21.840993118326033
Go out of mourning first	410.6204064167453
Hard to imagine his funeral	410.6204064167453
Seems a sort of a joke	598.1968110623764
Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer	5912.555183224002
Gives you second wind	126.99109556487812
New lease of life	111.05117566129712
How many have you for tomorrow	783.9243030199358
the caretaker asked	21.840993118326033
Two Corny Kelleher said	111.6792609014905
Half ten and eleven	126.99109556487812
The caretaker put the papers in his pocket	2339.445236569462
The barrow had ceased to trundle	862.742811655988
The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole stepping with care round the graves	599.4842503189408
The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink looping the bands round it	599.4842503189408
Burying him	1.1617274079423625
We come to bury Cæsar	410.6204064167453
His ides of March or June	949.4860105710369
He doesn t know who is here nor care	3051.6787972818342
Now who is that lankylooking galoot over there in the macintosh	5859.905040573966
Now who is he I d like to know	2628.4646617812436
Now I d give a trifle to know who he is	5712.386798681965
Always someone turns up you never dreamt of	2903.2601932065677
A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life	5189.306348086244
Yes he could	21.840993118326033
Still he d have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave	240.40991835099712
We all do	21.840993118326033
Only man buries	21.840993118326033
First thing strikes anybody	126.99109556487812
Bury the dead	21.840993118326033
Say Robinson Crusoe was true to life	1637.2623817614965
Well then Friday buried him	410.6204064167453
Every Friday buries a Thursday if you come to look at it	7017.038286703832
O poor Robinson Crusoe	126.99109556487812
How could you possibly do so	949.4860105710369
Poor Dignam	1.1617274079423625
His last lie on the earth in his box	3764.8668526744877
When you think of them all it does seem a waste of wood	3727.5937203149383
All gnawed through	21.840993118326033
They could invent a handsome bier with a kind of panel sliding let it down that way	599.4842503189408
Ay but they might object to be buried out of another fellow s	3727.5937203149383
They re so particular	126.99109556487812
Lay me in my native earth	851.2348218321658
Bit of clay from the holy land	1780.428763062773
Only a mother and deadborn child ever buried in the one coffin	7017.038286703832
I see what it means	328.36511569890223
I see	1.1617274079423625
To protect him as long as possible even in the earth	5707.064257871602
The Irishman s house is his coffin	1384.5404451516638
Embalming in catacombs mummies the same idea	1780.428763062773
Mr Bloom stood far back his hat in his hand counting the bared heads	2154.4346900318833
Twelve	1.1617274079423625
I m thirteen	21.840993118326033
No	1.1617274079423625
The chap in the macintosh is thirteen	1452.1988812430416
Death s number	21.840993118326033
He wasn t in the chapel that I ll swear	5562.856855515288
Silly superstition that about thirteen	410.6204064167453
Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit	4293.13994636419
Tinge of purple	21.840993118326033
I had one like that when we lived in Lombard street west	6862.551475901635
Dressy fellow he was once	410.6204064167453
Used to change three suits in the day	2549.312743403261
Must get that grey suit of mine turned by Mesias	5562.856855515288
Hello	1.1617274079423625
It s dyed	21.840993118326033
His wife I forgot he s not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him	240.40991835099712
The coffin dived out of sight eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles	1333.521432163324
They struggled up and out and all uncovered	2694.78913506113
Twenty	1.1617274079423625
Pause	1.1617274079423625
If we were all suddenly somebody else	1637.2623817614965
Far away a donkey brayed	410.6204064167453
Rain	1.1617274079423625
No such ass	21.840993118326033
Never see a dead one they say	1780.428763062773
Shame of death	21.840993118326033
Also poor papa went away	410.6204064167453
Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper	7317.42647154861
Whisper	1.1617274079423625
The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space	428.1332398719392
Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker	2703.245875619065
Wellcut frockcoat	1.1617274079423625
Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next	5562.856855515288
Well it is a long rest	824.5274024412339
Feel no more	21.840993118326033
It s the moment you feel	727.594155610759
Must be damned unpleasant	126.99109556487812
Can t believe it at first	851.2348218321658
Mistake must be someone else	410.6204064167453
I haven t yet	104.22607962703682
Then darkened deathchamber	21.840993118326033
Light they want	21.840993118326033
Whispering around you	21.840993118326033
Then rambling and wandering	126.99109556487812
Delirium all you hid all your life	1780.428763062773
The death struggle	21.840993118326033
His sleep is not natural	410.6204064167453
Press his lower eyelid	126.99109556487812
Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow	873.3261623828432
Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he s doomed	1333.521432163324
Devil in that picture of sinner s death showing him a woman	7017.038286703832
Dying to embrace her in his shirt	1510.9247026866935
Last act of	21.840993118326033
Shall I nevermore behold	126.99109556487812
Bam	1.1617274079423625
He expires	1.1617274079423625
Gone at last	21.840993118326033
People talk about you a bit forget you	2694.78913506113
Don t forget to pray for him	1637.2623817614965
Remember him in your prayers	410.6204064167453
Even Parnell	1.1617274079423625
Ivy day dying out	126.99109556487812
Then they follow dropping into a hole one after the other	7719.846677868277
We are praying now for the repose of his soul	4296.150039147476
Hoping you re well and not in hell	2694.78913506113
Nice change of air	126.99109556487812
Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory	7300.251061821653
Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself	4931.907717140106
They say you do when you shiver in the sun	4696.070955566602
Someone walking over it	111.05117566129712
Callboy s warning	21.840993118326033
Near you	1.1617274079423625
Mine over there towards Finglas the plot I bought	4293.13994636419
Mamma poor mamma and little Rudy	949.4860105710369
The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin	873.3261623828432
Mr Bloom turned away his face	824.5274024412339
And if he was alive all the time	1770.6472849303702
Whew	1.1617274079423625
By jingo that would be awful	862.742811655988
No no he is dead of course	1643.043796432458
Of course he is dead	329.912032313567
Monday he died	21.840993118326033
They ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole	41.011270705513006
Flag of distress	21.840993118326033
Three days	1.1617274079423625
Rather long to keep them in summer	1488.020769087348
Just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there s no	599.4842503189408
The clay fell softer	126.99109556487812
Begin to be forgotten	126.99109556487812
Out of sight out of mind	949.4860105710369
The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat	7017.038286703832
Had enough of it	126.99109556487812
The mourners took heart of grace one by one covering themselves without show	3727.5937203149383
Quietly sure of his ground he traversed the dismal fields	5562.856855515288
Hynes jotting down something in his notebook	1643.043796432458
Ah the names	21.840993118326033
But he knows them all	367.1967010491309
No coming to me	126.99109556487812
I am just taking the names Hynes said below his breath	7317.42647154861
What is your christian name	368.9265519088789
L Mr Bloom said	61.48239762771313
Leopold	1.1617274079423625
And you might put down M Coy s name too	5189.306348086244
He asked me to	87.8799991367897
Charley Hynes said writing	126.99109556487812
I know	1.1617274079423625
He was on the once	315.78952605321376
So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne	2154.4346900318833
Good idea a postmortem for doctors	949.4860105710369
Find out what they imagine they know	1643.043796432458
He died of a Tuesday	410.6204064167453
Got the run	21.840993118326033
Levanted with the cash of a few ads	2694.78913506113
Charley you re my darling	410.6204064167453
That was why he asked me to	1305.3354234048059
O well does no harm	410.6204064167453
I saw to that M Coy	712.3065003413022
Thanks old chap much obliged	367.1967010491309
Leave him under an obligation costs nothing	1780.428763062773
And tell us Hynes said do you know that fellow in the fellow was over there in the	428.1332398719392
Yes I saw him Mr Bloom said	779.9528652201533
Where is he now	85.69392923179171
M Intosh Hynes said scribbling	410.6204064167453
I don t know who he is	682.1478216281832
Is that his name	126.99109556487812
He moved away looking about him	949.4860105710369
No Mr Bloom began turning and stopping	1419.4772683741962
I say Hynes	21.840993118326033
Didn t hear	21.840993118326033
What	1.1617274079423625
Where has he disappeared to	410.6204064167453
Not a sign	21.840993118326033
Well of all the	86.09575381567483
Has anybody here seen	97.11203420129426
Kay ee double ell	97.11203420129426
Become invisible	1.1617274079423625
Good Lord what became of him	862.742811655988
A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade	3727.5937203149383
O excuse me	21.840993118326033
He stepped aside nimbly	126.99109556487812
Clay brown damp began to be seen in the hole	4779.48898135094
It rose	1.1617274079423625
Nearly over	1.1617274079423625
A mound of damp clods rose more rose and the gravediggers rested their spades	2154.4346900318833
All uncovered again for a few instants	1414.4825222071772
The boy propped his wreath against a corner the brother in law his on a lump	873.3261623828432
The gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow	2154.4346900318833
Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf clean	3754.265101828748
One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass	7017.038286703832
One leaving his mates walked slowly on with shouldered weapon its blade blueglancing	3727.5937203149383
Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband	2903.2601932065677
His navelcord	1.1617274079423625
The brother in law turning away placed something in his free hand	7017.038286703832
Thanks in silence	21.840993118326033
Headshake	1.1617274079423625
I know that	18.60036465451084
For yourselves just	21.840993118326033
The mourners moved away slowly without aim by devious paths staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb	240.40991835099712
Let us go round by the chief s grave Hynes said	6849.595667344242
We have time	21.840993118326033
Let us Mr Power said	248.3700309386597
They turned to the right following their slow thoughts	3106.889970333095
With awe Mr Power s blank voice spoke Some say he is not in that grave at all	428.1332398719392
That the coffin was filled with stones	1780.428763062773
That one day he will come again	1637.2623817614965
Hynes shook his head	108.9829112695572
Parnell will never come again he said	1637.2623817614965
He s there all that was mortal of him	4014.671278934556
Peace to his ashes	126.99109556487812
Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels crosses broken pillars family vaults stone hopes praying with upcast eyes old Ireland s hearts and hands	61.05402296585327
Pray for the repose of the soul of	1971.1953795974719
Does anybody really	21.840993118326033
Plant him and have done with him	1516.2600004008164
Like down a coalshoot	126.99109556487812
Then lump them together to save time	1780.428763062773
All souls day	21.840993118326033
Twentyseventh I ll be at his grave	1462.1519118532806
Ten shillings for the gardener	410.6204064167453
He keeps it free of weeds	949.4860105710369
Old man himself	21.840993118326033
Bent down double with his shears clipping	1780.428763062773
Who passed away	21.840993118326033
Who departed this life	126.99109556487812
As if they did it of their own accord	3510.749816246407
Got the shove all of them	803.3290774201911
Who kicked the bucket	111.6792609014905
More interesting if they told you what they were	4014.671278934556
So and So wheelwright	111.6792609014905
I travelled for cork lino	410.6204064167453
I paid five shillings in the pound	1637.2623817614965
Or a woman s with her saucepan	1508.8134788406453
Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell	316.227766016838
Entered into rest the protestants put it	1780.428763062773
Old Dr Murren s	126.99109556487812
The great physician called him home	949.4860105710369
Well it s God s acre for them	2601.4832449920805
Nice country residence	21.840993118326033
Newly plastered and painted	126.99109556487812
Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the Times Marriage ads they never try to beautify	428.1332398719392
Rusty wreaths hung on knobs garlands of bronzefoil	2903.2601932065677
Better value that for the money	851.2348218321658
Still the flowers are more poetical	949.4860105710369
The other gets rather tiresome never withering	1780.428763062773
Immortelles	1.1617274079423625
A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch	4293.13994636419
Like stuffed	1.1617274079423625
Like the wedding present alderman Hooper gave us	2903.2601932065677
Hoo	1.1617274079423625
Not a budge out of him	651.5067230632783
Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him	5233.841450267788
Dead animal even sadder	126.99109556487812
Silly Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave	187.38174228603845
The Sacred Heart that is showing it	1780.428763062773
Heart on his sleeve	126.99109556487812
Ought to be sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart	2154.4346900318833
Ireland was dedicated to it or whatever that	2694.78913506113
Seems anything but pleased	126.99109556487812
Why this infliction	21.840993118326033
Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy	52.983169062837085
Apollo that was	21.840993118326033
How many	1.1617274079423625
All these here once walked round Dublin	1780.428763062773
Faithful departed	1.1617274079423625
As you are now so once were we	2694.78913506113
Besides how could you remember everybody	949.4860105710369
Eyes walk voice	21.840993118326033
Well the voice yes gramophone	410.6204064167453
Have a gramophone in every grave or keep it in the house	6572.407569593274
After dinner on a Sunday	367.1967010491309
Put on poor old greatgrandfather	410.6204064167453
Kraahraark	1.1617274079423625
Hellohellohello amawfullyglad kraark awfullygladaseeagain hellohello amawf krpthsth	1780.428763062773
Remind you of the voice like the photograph reminds you of the face	3727.5937203149383
Otherwise you couldn t remember the face after fifteen years say	6196.714068736458
For instance who	21.840993118326033
A rattle of pebbles	126.99109556487812
Wait	1.1617274079423625
Stop	1.1617274079423625
He looked down intently into a stone crypt	2694.78913506113
Some animal	1.1617274079423625
Wait	1.1617274079423625
There he goes	18.040717293319346
An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt moving the pebbles	2154.4346900318833
An old stager greatgrandfather he knows the ropes	2903.2601932065677
The grey alive crushed itself in under the plinth wriggled itself in under it	2154.4346900318833
Good hidingplace for treasure	126.99109556487812
Who lives there	21.840993118326033
Are laid the remains of Robert Emery	1637.2623817614965
Robert Emmet was buried here by torchlight wasn t he	5562.856855515288
Tail gone now	21.840993118326033
One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow	6739.22059532656
Pick the bones clean no matter who it was	4014.671278934556
Ordinary meat for them	126.99109556487812
A corpse is meat gone bad	949.4860105710369
Well and what s cheese	367.1967010491309
Corpse of milk	21.840993118326033
I read in that in that the Chinese say a white man smells like a corpse	873.3261623828432
Cremation better	1.1617274079423625
Priests dead against it	126.99109556487812
Wholesale burners and Dutch oven dealers	949.4860105710369
Time of the plague	111.05117566129712
Quicklime feverpits to eat them	410.6204064167453
Lethal chamber	1.1617274079423625
Ashes to ashes	21.840993118326033
Or bury at sea	126.99109556487812
Where is that Parsee tower of silence	1643.043796432458
Eaten by birds	21.840993118326033
Earth fire water	21.840993118326033
Drowning they say is the pleasantest	783.9243030199358
See your whole life in a flash	1780.428763062773
But being brought back to life no	1637.2623817614965
Can t bury in the air however	1307.5851358569478
Out of a flying machine	410.6204064167453
Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down	3727.5937203149383
Underground communication	1.1617274079423625
We learned that from them	367.1967010491309
Wouldn t be surprised	111.05117566129712
Regular square feed for them	410.6204064167453
Flies come before he s well dead	1780.428763062773
Got wind of Dignam	126.99109556487812
They wouldn t care about the smell of it	3341.60504859796
Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse smell taste like raw white turnips	7719.846677868277
The gates glimmered in front still open	1780.428763062773
Back to the world again	348.29171113587296
Enough of this place	126.99109556487812
Brings you a bit nearer every time	1637.2623817614965
Last time I was here was Mrs Sinico s funeral	4936.925688118698
Poor papa too	21.840993118326033
The love that kills	126.99109556487812
And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores	46.415888336127786

This ad you see	126.99109556487812
Keyes you remember	21.840993118326033
Mr Nannetti considered the cutting awhile and nodded	2903.2601932065677
The foreman moved his pencil towards it	1505.608178403045
But wait Mr Bloom said	224.34779203401013

The foreman turned round to hear patiently and lifting an elbow began to scratch slowly in the armpit of his alpaca jacket	149.24955450518294
Like that Mr Bloom said crossing his forefingers at the top	4969.6950104564185
Let him take that in first	949.4860105710369
Mr Bloom glancing sideways up from the cross he had made saw the foreman s sallow face think he has a touch of jaundice and beyond the obedient reels feeding in huge webs of paper	24.484367468222267

Do you think that s a good idea	1744.0967165028862
The foreman moved his scratching hand to his lower ribs and scratched there quietly	2154.4346900318833

We can do that he said	610.80692016425
Let him give us a three months renewal	2666.78996584088
A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage	1637.2623817614965
He began to check it silently	851.2348218321658

He took off his silk hat and blowing out impatiently his bushy moustache welshcombed his hair with raking fingers	316.227766016838
Ned Lambert tossed the newspaper aside chuckling with delight	4293.13994636419
An instant after a hoarse bark of laughter burst over professor MacHugh s unshaven blackspectacled face	873.3261623828432

My dear Myles he said flinging his cigarette aside you put a false construction on my words	599.4842503189408
Why not bring in Henry Grattan and Flood and Demosthenes and Edmund Burke	3727.5937203149383
Ignatius Gallaher we all know and his Chapelizod boss Harmsworth of the farthing press and his American cousin of the Bowery guttersheet not to mention Kelly s s and our watchful friend Skibbereen	29.552092352028872

O Molloy said Bushe K C for example	2137.206018816292
Bushe	1.1617274079423625
the editor said	15.170374500557935
Well yes Bushe yes	126.99109556487812
He has a strain of it in his blood	3194.956910197428
Kendal Bushe or I mean Seymour Bushe	1643.043796432458

J	1.1617274079423625
J	1.1617274079423625
O Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe	32.74549162877729
It was in that case of fratricide the Childs murder case	6308.356683939008
Bushe defended him	21.840993118326033
in the porches of mine ear did pour By the way how did he find that out	599.4842503189408
He died in his sleep	367.1967010491309
Or the other story beast with two backs	2501.287517886216
What was that	17.06185700055526
the professor asked	18.469695921350887
ITALIA MAGISTRA ARTIUM He spoke on the law of evidence J	6710.797703763863
J	1.1617274079423625
O Molloy said of Roman justice as contrasted with the earlier Mosaic code the	2154.4346900318833
And he cited the Moses of Michelangelo in the vatican	5912.555183224002

O Molloy took out his cigarettecase	773.4676608087022
False lull	1.1617274079423625
Something quite ordinary	21.840993118326033
Messenger took out his matchbox thoughtfully and lit his cigar	5515.522139545052
I have often thought since on looking back over that strange time that it was that small act trivial in itself that striking of that match that determined the whole aftercourse of both our lives	24.484367468222267
J	1.1617274079423625
O Molloy resumed moulding his words He said of it stony effigy in frozen music horned and terrible of the human form divine that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live deserves to live His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall	5.4361836201538365

O Molloy asked Stephen	111.6792609014905
Stephen his blood wooed by grace of language and gesture blushed	6903.461660503397
He took a cigarette from the case	1232.3790810420264
J	1.1617274079423625

Magennis thinks you must have been pulling A	2137.206018816292

What did he say about me	739.2067167905801
Don t ask	18.469695921350887
No thanks professor MacHugh said waving the cigarettecase aside	3710.7749288817636
Wait a moment	18.60036465451084
Let me say one thing	410.6204064167453
The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical society	187.38174228603845
Mr Justice Fitzgibbon the present lord justice of appeal had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay new for those days advocating the revival of the Irish tongue	41.011270705513006
He turned towards Myles Crawford and said You know Gerald Fitzgibbon	7300.251061821653
Then you can imagine the style of his discourse	4014.671278934556
J	1.1617274079423625
O Molloy said rumour has it on the Trinity college estates commission	6826.1887012141
He is sitting with a sweet thing Myles Crawford said in a child s frock	1333.521432163324
Go on	1.1617274079423625
Well	1.1617274079423625
It was the speech mark you the professor said of a finished orator full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man s contumely upon the new movement	14.547578108480476
It was then a new movement	783.9243030199358
We were weak therefore worthless	410.6204064167453
He closed his long thin lips an instant but eager to be on raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims steadied them to a new focus	20.691380811147894
IMPROMPTU In ferial tone he addressed J	1780.428763062773
J	1.1617274079423625
O Molloy Taylor had come there you must know from a sickbed	7017.038286703832
That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall	240.40991835099712
His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it	7017.038286703832
He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked though he was not a dying man	428.1332398719392
His gaze turned at once but slowly from J	4293.13994636419
J	1.1617274079423625
O Molloy s towards Stephen s face and then bent at once to the ground seeking	873.3261623828432
His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head soiled by his withering hair	2154.4346900318833
Still seeking he said When Fitzgibbon s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply	873.3261623828432
Briefly as well as I can bring them to mind his words were these	2154.4346900318833
He raised his head firmly	368.9265519088789
His eyes bethought themselves once more	949.4860105710369
Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro seeking outlet	7017.038286703832
He began Mr Chairman ladies and gentlemen Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend	46.415888336127786
It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country into an age remote from this age that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech	5.30441727984393
let our crooked smokes Noble words coming	1505.608178403045
Look out	1.1617274079423625
Could you try your hand at it yourself	2903.2601932065677
And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride	100.00000000000001
I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me FROM THE FATHERS It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted	13.68874509537081
That s saint Augustine	126.99109556487812
Why will you jews not accept our culture our religion and our language	3727.5937203149383
You are a tribe of nomad herdsmen we are a mighty people	7017.038286703832
You have no cities nor no wealth our cities are hives of humanity and our galleys trireme and quadrireme laden with all manner merchandise furrow the waters of the known globe	36.51741272548377
You have but emerged from primitive conditions we have a literature a priesthood an agelong history and a polity Nile	240.40991835099712

Yours serfdom awe and humbleness ours thunder and the seas	5233.841450267788
Israel is weak and few are her children Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms	599.4842503189408
He lifted his voice above it boldly But ladies and gentlemen had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day	6.042963902381328
He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law graven in the language of the outlaw He ceased and looked at them enjoying a silence	8.11130830789687

J	1.1617274079423625
J	1.1617274079423625
O Molloy said not without regret And yet he died without having entered the land of promise	599.4842503189408
A sudden at the moment though from lingering illness often previously expectorated demise Lenehan added	1333.521432163324
And with a great future behind him	1637.2623817614965
The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase	873.3261623828432
That is oratory the professor said uncontradicted	1331.7681062795018
Gone with the wind	126.99109556487812

Gentlemen Stephen said	21.840993118326033
As the next motion on the agenda paper may I suggest that the house do now adjourn	599.4842503189408
You take my breath away	410.6204064167453
It is not perchance a French compliment	1618.1370847032842
Mr O Madden Burke asked	192.85696612059766
Tis the hour methinks when the winejug metaphorically speaking is most grateful in Ye ancient hostelry	873.3261623828432
That it be and hereby is resolutely resolved	2903.2601932065677
All that are in favour say ay Lenehan announced	4293.13994636419
The contrary no	21.840993118326033
I declare it carried	126.99109556487812
To which particular boosing shed	410.6204064167453
My casting vote is Mooney s	949.4860105710369

Let us go	18.469695921350887
Where are those blasted keys	410.6204064167453

LET US HOPE J	126.99109556487812

O Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently	5233.841450267788
They caught up on the others and walked abreast	3508.8177301592364
When they have eaten the brawn and the bread and wiped their twenty fingers in the paper the bread was wrapped in they go nearer to the railings	52.983169062837085
Something for you the professor explained to Myles Crawford	3754.265101828748

They put the bag of plums between them and eat the plums out of it one after another wiping off with their handkerchiefs the plumjuice that dribbles out of their mouths and spitting the plumstones slowly out between the railings	16.57723885589317
He gave a sudden loud young laugh as a close	5912.555183224002

Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him	2154.4346900318833

Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting	7109.842500848915
So long	1.1617274079423625
Nosey Flynn said	12.386558911098714

Their upper jaw they move	410.6204064167453
Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his	7017.038286703832
Wasting time explaining it to Flynn s mouth	2903.2601932065677
Lean people long mouths	126.99109556487812

A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane	7719.846677868277
No tram in sight	126.99109556487812
Wants to cross	21.840993118326033
Do you want to cross	222.52440739805112
Mr Bloom asked	14.730183987478947
The blind stripling did not answer	866.2253711860347
His wallface frowned weakly	126.99109556487812
He moved his head uncertainly	410.6204064167453
You re in Dawson street Mr Bloom said	1806.6459972085936
Molesworth street is opposite	126.99109556487812
Do you want to cross	222.52440739805112
There s nothing in the way	668.6181258495413
The cane moved out trembling to the left	2469.1133923535576
Mr Bloom s eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks van drawn up before Drago s	428.1332398719392
Where I saw his brillantined hair just when I was	4173.389954663512
Horse drooping	1.1617274079423625
Driver in John Long s	367.1967010491309
Slaking his drouth	21.840993118326033
There s a van there Mr Bloom said but it s not moving	3727.5937203149383
I ll see you across	331.46623639848457
Do you want to go to Molesworth street	1724.8811551842628
Yes the stripling answered	126.99109556487812
South Frederick street	21.840993118326033
Come Mr Bloom said	61.48239762771313
He touched the thin elbow gently then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward	873.3261623828432
Say something to him	126.99109556487812
Better not do the condescending	410.6204064167453
Pass a common remark	126.99109556487812
The rain kept off	126.99109556487812
No answer	1.1617274079423625
Stains on his coat	111.05117566129712
Slobbers his food I suppose	410.6204064167453
Tastes all different for him	410.6204064167453
Have to be spoonfed first	410.6204064167453
Like a child s hand his hand	1643.043796432458
Like Milly s was	126.99109556487812
Sensitive	1.1617274079423625
Sizing me up I daresay from my hand	2903.2601932065677
Wonder if he has a name	686.2616853136605
Van	1.1617274079423625
Keep his cane clear of the horse s legs tired drudge get his doze	2154.4346900318833

Right now	1.1617274079423625
First turn to the left	322.04988014226984
The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way drawing his cane back feeling again	599.4842503189408
Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed	3727.5937203149383
Poor young fellow	21.840993118326033
How on earth did he know that van was there	5562.856855515288
Must have felt it	126.99109556487812
See things in their forehead perhaps kind of sense of volume	6903.461660503397
Weight or size of it something blacker than the dark	5562.856855515288
Wonder would he feel it if something was removed	4293.13994636419
Feel a gap	21.840993118326033
Queer idea of Dublin he must have tapping his way round by the stones	2154.4346900318833
Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn t that cane	7017.038286703832
Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest	6903.969158071153
Penrose	1.1617274079423625
That was that chap s name	862.742811655988
Look at all the things they can learn to do	5189.306348086244
Read with their fingers	126.99109556487812
Tune pianos	1.1617274079423625
Or we are surprised they have any brains	2903.2601932065677
Why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say	599.4842503189408
Of course the other senses are more	1505.608178403045
Embroider	1.1617274079423625
Plait baskets	1.1617274079423625
People ought to help	126.99109556487812
Workbasket I could buy for Molly s birthday	2703.245875619065
Hates sewing	1.1617274079423625
Might take an objection	126.99109556487812
Dark men they call them	368.9265519088789
Sense of smell must be stronger too	1780.428763062773
Smells on all sides bunched together	803.3290774201911
Each street different smell	126.99109556487812
Each person too	21.840993118326033
Then the spring the summer smells	949.4860105710369
Tastes	1.1617274079423625
They say you can t taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head	599.4842503189408
Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure	4669.107825280759
And with a woman for instance	787.0887026711796
More shameless not seeing	126.99109556487812
That girl passing the Stewart institution head in the air	4444.302493610735
Look at me	21.840993118326033
I have them all on	367.1967010491309
Must be strange not to see her	1419.4772683741962
Kind of a form in his mind s eye	3131.900879031242
The voice temperatures when he touches her with his fingers must almost see the lines the curves	599.4842503189408
His hands on her hair for instance	1637.2623817614965
Say it was black for instance	949.4860105710369
Good	1.1617274079423625
Then passing over her white skin	949.4860105710369
Different feel perhaps	21.840993118326033
Feeling of white	21.840993118326033
Postoffice	1.1617274079423625
Must answer	1.1617274079423625

Stationer s just here too	410.6204064167453
Wait	1.1617274079423625
Think over it	21.840993118326033
With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his ears	873.3261623828432
Again	1.1617274079423625
Fibres of fine fine straw	410.6204064167453
Then gently his finger felt the skin of his right cheek	7300.251061821653
Downy hair there too	126.99109556487812
Not smooth enough	21.840993118326033
The belly is the smoothest	410.6204064167453
No one about	18.469695921350887
There he goes into Frederick street	851.2348218321658
Perhaps to Levenston s dancing academy piano	1780.428763062773
Might be settling my braces	410.6204064167453
Walking by Doran s publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat and trousers and pulling aside his shirt gently felt a slack fold of his belly	61.05402296585327
But I know it s whitey yellow	1618.137084703284
Want to try in the dark to see	2175.4930456247503
He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to	3477.9033107243026
Poor fellow	1.1617274079423625
Terrible	1.1617274079423625
Really terrible	1.1617274079423625
What dreams would he have not seeing	1618.137084703284
Life a dream for him	410.6204064167453
Where is the justice being born that way	2694.78913506113

Wear out my welcome	126.99109556487812
Sure to know someone on the gate	1780.428763062773
Mr Bloom came to Kildare street	862.742811655988
First I must	21.840993118326033

Won t look	21.840993118326033
Wine in my face	126.99109556487812
Why did I	18.60036465451084
Too heady	1.1617274079423625
Yes it is	18.040717293319346
The walk	1.1617274079423625
Not see	1.1617274079423625
Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes	3727.5937203149383
Handsome building	1.1617274079423625
Sir Thomas Deane designed	111.05117566129712
Not following me	21.840993118326033
Didn t see me perhaps	329.912032313567
Light in his eyes	89.02087655500138
The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs	5233.841450267788
Quick	1.1617274079423625
Cold statues quiet there	126.99109556487812

Just at the gate	111.6792609014905
My heart	1.1617274079423625
His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone	5912.555183224002
Sir Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture	1637.2623817614965
Look for something I	126.99109556487812
His hasty hand went quick into a pocket took out read unfolded Agendath Netaim	2154.4346900318833
Where did I	18.040717293319346
Busy looking	1.1617274079423625
He thrust back quick Agendath	410.6204064167453

If thou didst ever	126.99109556487812
What is a ghost	111.05117566129712
Stephen said with tingling energy	348.2917111358729
One who has faded into impalpability through death through absence through change of manners	2154.4346900318833
Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virgin Dublin	2154.4346900318833
Who is the ghost from returning to the world that has forgotten him	3727.5937203149383
Who is King Hamlet	126.99109556487812
It is this hour of a day in mid June Stephen said begging with a swift glance their hearing	316.227766016838

The play begins	21.840993118326033
A player comes on under the shadow made up in the castoff mail of a court buck a wellset man with a bass voice	100.00000000000001
It is the ghost the king a king and no king and the player is Shakespeare who has studied all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre	19.14481976169958
He speaks the words to Burbage the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth calling him by a name Hamlet I am thy father s spirit bidding him list	29.552092352028872
To a son he speaks the son of his soul the prince young Hamlet and to the son of his body Hamnet Shakespeare who has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever	24.484367468222267
Is it possible that that player Shakespeare a ghost by absence and in the vesture of buried Denmark a ghost by death speaking his own words to his own son s name had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet s twin is it possible I want to know or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises you are the dispossessed son I am the murdered father your mother is the guilty queen Ann Shakespeare born Hathaway	3.75588809068008

Her ghost at least has been laid for ever	4293.13994636419
She died for literature at least before she was born	5577.135999216109
She died Stephen retorted sixtyseven years after she was born	5247.276053407287
She saw him into and out of the world	1995.6309744230289
She took his first embraces	410.6204064167453
She bore his children and she laid pennies on his eyes to keep his eyelids closed when he lay on his deathbed	149.24955450518294

John Eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp	5912.555183224002
The world believes that Shakespeare made a mistake he said and got out of it as quickly and as best he could	149.24955450518294
Bosh	1.1617274079423625
Stephen said rudely	21.840993118326033
A man of genius makes no mistakes	1780.428763062773
His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery	5912.555183224002
Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian softcreakfooted bald eared and assiduous	1333.521432163324
A shrew John Eglinton said shrewdly is not a useful portal of discovery one should imagine	873.3261623828432
What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe	2903.2601932065677
Dialectic Stephen answered and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world	2154.4346900318833
What he learnt from his other wife Myrto nomen Socratididion s Epipsychidion no man not a woman will ever know	240.40991835099712
But neither the midwife s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock	149.24955450518294
But Ann Hathaway	21.840993118326033
Mr Best s quiet voice said forgetfully	1618.1370847032842
Yes we seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her	7017.038286703832
His look went from brooder s beard to carper s skull to remind to chide them not unkindly then to the baldpink lollard costard guiltless though maligned	61.05402296585327
He had a good groatsworth of wit Stephen said and no truant memory	3727.5937203149383
He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling girl I left behind me If the earthquake did not time it we should know where to place poor Wat sitting in his form the cry of hounds the studded bridle and her blue windows	10.481131341546856

Not even so much	126.99109556487812

A shadow hangs over all the rest	1452.1988812430416
But is so personal isn t it	1508.8134788406453
Mr Best pleaded	21.840993118326033
I mean a kind of private paper don t you know of his private life	1333.521432163324
I mean I don t care a button don t you know who is killed or who is guilty	316.227766016838

Quoth littlejohn Eglinton I was prepared for paradoxes from what Malachi Mulligan told us but I may as well warn you that if you want to shake my belief that Shakespeare is Hamlet you have a stern task before you	16.57723885589317
Bear with me	21.840993118326033
Stephen withstood the bane of miscreant eyes glinting stern under wrinkled brows	7017.038286703832
A basilisk	1.1617274079423625
quando vede l uomo l	410.6204064167453
Messer Brunetto I thank thee for the word	2694.78913506113
As we or mother Dana weave and unweave our bodies Stephen said from day to day their molecules shuttled to and fro so does the artist weave and unweave his image	36.51741272548377
And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth	12.216773489967919
So in the future the sister of the past I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be	52.983169062837085
Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile	2694.78913506113
Yes Mr Best said youngly	348.29171113587296
I feel Hamlet quite young	410.6204064167453
The bitterness might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son	599.4842503189408
Has the wrong sow by the lug	1780.428763062773
He is in my father	410.6204064167453
I am in his son	367.1967010491309
That mole is the last to go Stephen said laughing	5912.555183224002
If that were the birthmark of genius he said genius would be a drug in the market	599.4842503189408
The plays of Shakespeare s later years which Renan admired so much breathe another spirit	1333.521432163324
The spirit of reconciliation the quaker librarian breathed	2437.01061835555
There can be no reconciliation Stephen said if there has not been a sundering	2154.4346900318833
Said that	1.1617274079423625
If you want to know what are the events which cast their shadow over the hell of time of Lear Othello Hamlet Troilus and Cressida look to see when and how the shadow lifts	26.826957952797255

Word known to all men	331.46623639848457
vero aliquid alicui bonum vult unde et ea quae concupiscimus His own image to a man with that queer thing genius is the standard of all experience material and moral	41.011270705513006
Such an appeal will touch him	949.4860105710369
The images of other males of his blood will repel him	7719.846677868277
He will see in them grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself	1333.521432163324
The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope	6769.978219530771
I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public	1333.521432163324
And we ought to mention another Irish commentator Mr George Bernard Shaw	7017.038286703832
Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris	1780.428763062773
His articles on Shakespeare in the were surely brilliant	4293.13994636419
Oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets	599.4842503189408
The favoured rival is William Herbert earl of Pembroke	4293.13994636419
I own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in harmony with what shall I say our notions of what ought not to have been	36.51741272548377
Felicitously he ceased and held a meek head among them auk s egg prize of their fray	599.4842503189408
He thous and thees her with grave husbandwords	2903.2601932065677
Dost love Miriam	21.840993118326033
Dost love thy man	126.99109556487812
That may be too Stephen said	862.742811655988
There s a saying of Goethe s which Mr Magee likes to quote	3727.5937203149383
Why does he send to one who is a a bay where all men ride a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood a lordling to woo for him	46.415888336127786
He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written and	316.227766016838
Why	1.1617274079423625
Belief in himself has been untimely killed	1780.428763062773
He was overborne in a cornfield first ryefield I should say and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down	29.552092352028872
Assumed dongiovannism will not save him	949.4860105710369
No later undoing will undo the first undoing	2903.2601932065677
If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman s invisible weapon	2154.4346900318833
There is I feel in the words some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion a darker shadow of the first darkening even his own understanding of himself	36.51741272548377
A like fate awaits him and the two rages commingle in a whirlpool	3727.5937203149383
They list	1.1617274079423625
And in the porches of their ears I pour	3520.663898982717
But those who are done to death in sleep cannot know the manner of their quell unless their Creator endow their souls with that knowledge in the life to come	41.011270705513006
The poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet s ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator	52.983169062837085
That is why the speech his lean unlovely English is always turned elsewhere backward	2154.4346900318833
Ravisher and ravished what he would but would not go with him from Lucrece s bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen s breast bare with its mole cinquespotted	61.05402296585327
He goes back weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself an old dog licking an old sore	121.15276586285881
But because loss is his gain he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed	52.983169062837085
His beaver is up	126.99109556487812
He is a ghost a shadow now the wind by Elsinore s rocks or what you will the sea s voice a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow the son consubstantial with the father	13.68874509537081
Amen	1.1617274079423625
was responded from the doorway	361.48876812228025
Hast thou found me O mine enemy	1780.428763062773

My telegram	1.1617274079423625

Primrosevested he greeted gaily with his doffed Panama as with a bauble	7017.038286703832
They make him welcome	126.99109556487812

O flowers	1.1617274079423625
Bells with bells with bells aquiring	949.4860105710369
Yes indeed the quaker librarian said	688.8590556775348
A most instructive discussion	126.99109556487812
Mr Mulligan I ll be bound has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare	873.3261623828432
All sides of life should be represented	1780.428763062773
He smiled on all sides equally	803.3290774201911
Buck Mulligan thought puzzled Shakespeare	410.6204064167453
he said	1.1617274079423625
I seem to know the name	787.0887026711796
A flying sunny smile rayed in his loose features	4293.13994636419
To be sure he said remembering brightly	1618.1370847032842
The chap that writes like Synge	949.4860105710369
Mr Best turned to him	328.36511569890223
Haines missed you he said	305.4025733674428

I came through the museum Buck Mulligan said	2034.8254081478171
Was he here	21.840993118326033
The bard s fellowcountrymen John Eglinton answered are rather tired perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising	873.3261623828432
I hear that an actress played Hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in Dublin	1333.521432163324

For Willie Hughes is it not	949.4860105710369
the quaker librarian asked	81.0348424650412
Or Hughie Wills	21.840993118326033
Mr William Himself	21.840993118326033
W	1.1617274079423625
I mean for Willie Hughes Mr Best said amending his gloss easily	7017.038286703832
It s the very essence of Wilde don t you know	3850.194711353871
His glance touched their faces lightly as he smiled a blond ephebe	7017.038286703832
Tame essence of Wilde	111.05117566129712
You re darned witty	126.99109556487812

Do you think it is only a paradox	2038.6355886334247
the quaker librarian was asking	315.78952605321376
The mocker is never taken seriously when he is most serious	7243.2890197195
They talked seriously of mocker s seriousness	1780.428763062773
Buck Mulligan s again heavy face eyed Stephen awhile	3667.3246827145394

Kind air defined the coigns of houses in Kildare street	5562.856855515288
No birds	1.1617274079423625
Frail from the housetops two plumes of smoke ascended pluming and in a flaw of softness softly were blown	316.227766016838

Just nice time to walk to Artane	1637.2623817614965

Oblige him if possible	126.99109556487812
A onelegged sailor swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches growled some notes	1333.521432163324
He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S	71.09709432312432
J	1.1617274079423625
Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held he knew one silver crown	873.3261623828432
Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square	949.4860105710369
He thought but not for long of soldiers and sailors whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs ending their days in some pauper ward and of cardinal Wolsey s words I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old days He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy M P	4.840960141478948
Very well indeed father	126.99109556487812
And you father	21.840993118326033
Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed	866.2253711860347
And her boys were they getting on well at Belvedere	5912.555183224002
Was that so	21.840993118326033
Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that	3189.525901359734
And Mr Sheehy himself	126.99109556487812
Still in London	21.840993118326033
The house was still sitting to be sure it was	4640.209825509239
Beautiful weather it was delightful indeed	949.4860105710369
Yes it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach	2154.4346900318833
O yes a very great success	862.742811655988
A wonderful man really	126.99109556487812
Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M P	1333.521432163324
Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M P	1333.521432163324
Yes he would certainly call	367.1967010491309
Good afternoon Mrs Sheehy	126.99109556487812
Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled as he took leave at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun	121.15276586285881
And smiled yet again in going	949.4860105710369
He had cleaned his teeth he knew with arecanut paste	5912.555183224002
Father Conmee walked and walking smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan s droll eyes and cockney voice	316.227766016838
Pilate	1.1617274079423625
Wy don t you old back that owlin mob	3220.4919536994853
Really he was	21.840993118326033
And really did great good in his way	2601.4832449920805
Beyond a doubt	21.840993118326033
He loved Ireland he said and he loved the Irish	4872.400135111191
Of good family too would one think it	2903.2601932065677
Welsh were they not	126.99109556487812
O lest he forget	126.99109556487812
That letter to father provincial	328.36511569890223
Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy square	6842.36577415254
Yes they were from Belvedere	410.6204064167453
The little house	21.840993118326033
Aha	1.1617274079423625
And were they good boys at school	1780.428763062773
O	1.1617274079423625
That was very good now	410.6204064167453
And what was his name	289.07550456188324
Jack Sohan	1.1617274079423625
And his name	21.840993118326033
Ger	1.1617274079423625
Gallaher	1.1617274079423625
His name was Brunny Lynam	367.1967010491309
O that was a very nice name to have	3207.0021581873734
Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street	100.00000000000001
But mind you don t post yourself into the box little man he said	2154.4346900318833
The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed O sir	4026.008396445538
Well let me see if you can post a letter Father Conmee said	3727.5937203149383
Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee s letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox	100.00000000000001
Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east	3727.5937203149383
Mr Denis J Maginni professor of dancing c in silk hat slate frockcoat with silk facings white kerchief tie tight lavender trousers canary gloves and pointed patent boots walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam s court	10.0
Was that not Mrs M Guinness	862.742811655988
Mrs M Guinness stately silverhaired bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed	599.4842503189408
And Father Conmee smiled and saluted	783.9243030199358
How did she do	111.05117566129712
A fine carriage she had	410.6204064167453
Like Mary queen of Scots something	949.4860105710369
And to think that she was a pawnbroker	1881.342958874763
Well now	1.1617274079423625
Such a	1.1617274079423625
what should he say	126.99109556487812
such a queenly mien	126.99109556487812
Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left	599.4842503189408
R	1.1617274079423625
Greene B A	21.840993118326033
will D V speak	126.99109556487812
The incumbent they called him	367.1967010491309
He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words	6139.651906331274
But one should be charitable	410.6204064167453
Invincible ignorance	1.1617274079423625
Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road	6858.149107822089
It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare	1333.521432163324
Surely there ought to be	287.9926367845682
A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street	4293.13994636419
All raised untidy caps	126.99109556487812
Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly	2601.4832449920805
Christian brother boys	21.840993118326033
Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked	5944.087641117937
Saint Joseph s church Portland row	866.2253711860347
For aged and virtuous females	410.6204064167453
Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament	3123.0815411655603
Virtuous but occasionally they were also badtempered	1780.428763062773
Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman	4853.265889544621
And now it was an office or something	2321.680448289125
Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop	83.76776400682921
Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter	316.227766016838
He passed Grogan s the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York	316.227766016838
In America those things were continually happening	1780.428763062773
Unfortunate people to die like that unprepared	1637.2623817614965
Still an act of perfect contrition	866.2253711860347
Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged	599.4842503189408
They saluted him and were saluted	949.4860105710369
Father Conmee passed H	126.99109556487812
J	1.1617274079423625
O Neill s funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay	240.40991835099712
A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable	2154.4346900318833
In Youkstetter s the porkbutcher s Father Conmee observed pig s puddings white and black and red lie neatly curled in tubes	149.24955450518294
Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge a towhorse with pendent head a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him	20.691380811147894
It was idyllic and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people	13.68874509537081
On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S	2839.639353068077
J	1.1617274079423625
of saint Francis Xavier s church upper Gardiner street stepped on to an outward bound tram	873.3261623828432
Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C	7719.846677868277
C	1.1617274079423625
of saint Agatha s church north William street on to Newcomen bridge	7017.038286703832
At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island	100.00000000000001
Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove while four shillings a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse	16.57723885589317
Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket	149.24955450518294
The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap	240.40991835099712
Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum	410.6204064167453
It was a peaceful day	297.0167312896878
The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down	2154.4346900318833
His wife Father Conmee supposed	410.6204064167453
Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car	2903.2601932065677
He perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat	187.38174228603845
Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head	121.15276586285881
At Annesley bridge the tram halted and when it was about to go an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight	121.15276586285881
The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her	7317.42647154861
She passed out with her basket and a marketnet and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down and Father Conmee thought that as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice you my child that they have been absolved for me But they had so many worries in life so many cares poor creatures	4.548777947003777
From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee	3727.5937203149383
Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S	149.24955450518294
J	1.1617274079423625
and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night	15.505157798326243
That book by the Belgian jesuit Nombre des Élus seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea	873.3261623828432
Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not D V been brought	121.15276586285881
But they were God s souls created by God	3754.265101828748
It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost a waste if one might say	316.227766016838
At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn	428.1332398719392
The Malahide road was quiet	410.6204064167453
It pleased Father Conmee road and name	1780.428763062773
The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide	1780.428763062773
Lord Talbot de Malahide immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining	2154.4346900318833
Then came the call to arms and she was maid wife and widow in one day	873.3261623828432
Those were old worldish days loyal times in joyous townlands old times in the barony	1333.521432163324
Father Conmee walking thought of his little book Times in the and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort daughter of lord Molesworth first countess of Belvedere	26.826957952797255
A listless lady no more young walked alone the shore of lough Ennel Mary first countess of Belvedere listlessly walking in the evening not startled when an otter plunged	46.415888336127786
Who could know the truth	410.6204064167453
Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully seminis inter vas naturale mulieris with her husband s brother	71.09709432312432
She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did	3727.5937203149383
Only God knew and she and he her husband s brother	6202.493268344296
Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence needed however for man s race on earth and of the ways of God which were not our ways	71.09709432312432
Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore	5247.276053407287
He was humane and honoured there	949.4860105710369
He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom ceiled with full fruit clusters	149.24955450518294
And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom noble to noble were impalmed by Don John Conmee	316.227766016838
It was a charming day	297.0167312896878
The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages curtseying to him with ample underleaves	599.4842503189408
The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind	1333.521432163324
the French said	21.840993118326033
A just and homely word	410.6204064167453
Father Conmee reading his office watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey	3727.5937203149383
His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field	7719.846677868277
He walked there reading in the evening and heard the cries of the boys lines at their play young cries in the quiet evening	100.00000000000001
He was their rector his reign was mild	2903.2601932065677
Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out	7017.038286703832
Nones	1.1617274079423625
He should have read that before lunch	1780.428763062773
But lady Maxwell had come	410.6204064167453
Father Conmee read in secret and and crossed his breast	5912.555183224002
in adiutorium He walked calmly and read mutely the nones walking and reading till he came to in immaculati Principium verborum tuorum veritas in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand	8.11130830789687
Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary	3727.5937203149383
Principes persecuti sunt me gratis et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner	32.74549162877729
He pulled himself erect went to it and spinning it on its axle viewed its shape and brass furnishings	316.227766016838
Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway	1333.521432163324
There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase looking idly out	316.227766016838
Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge	7300.251061821653
Corny Kelleher locked his largefooted boots and gazed his hat downtilted chewing his blade of hay	873.3261623828432
Constable C on his beat stood to pass the time of day	6881.020994144466
That s a fine day Mr Kelleher	1331.6722456371695
Ay Corny Kelleher said	111.6792609014905
It s very close the constable said	1637.2623817614965
Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin	61.05402296585327
What s the best news	243.44092346928798
he asked	1.1617274079423625
I seen that particular party last evening the constable said with bated breath	3727.5937203149383
A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell s corner skirting Rabaiotti s icecream car and jerked himself up Eccles street	240.40991835099712
Towards Larry O Rourke in shirtsleeves in his doorway he growled unamiably	7017.038286703832
He swung himself violently forward past Katey and Boody Dedalus halted and growled and beauty J	873.3261623828432
J	1.1617274079423625
O Molloy s white careworn face was told that Mr Lambert was in the warehouse with a visitor	428.1332398719392
A stout lady stopped took a copper coin from her purse and dropped it into the cap held out to her	187.38174228603845
The sailor grumbled thanks glanced sourly at the unheeding windows sank his head and swung himself forward four strides	316.227766016838
He halted and growled angrily	367.1967010491309
Two barefoot urchins sucking long liquorice laces halted near him gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths	428.1332398719392
He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks halted lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply and beauty The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two ceased	32.74549162877729
The blind of the window was drawn aside	2601.4832449920805
A plump bare generous arm shone was seen held forth from a white petticoatbodice and taut shiftstraps	599.4842503189408
A woman s hand flung forth a coin over the area railings	7017.038286703832
It fell on the path	368.9265519088789
One of the urchins ran to it picked it up and dropped it into the minstrel s cap saying There sir	187.38174228603845
Katey and Boody Dedalus shoved in the door of the closesteaming kitchen	5729.832860820689
Did you put in the books	866.2253711860347
Boody asked	1.1617274079423625
Maggy at the range rammed down a greyish mass beneath bubbling suds twice with her potstick and wiped her brow	240.40991835099712
They wouldn t give anything on them she said	3764.8668526744877
Father Conmee walked through Clongowes fields his thinsocked ankles tickled by stubble	7017.038286703832
Where did you try	111.6792609014905
Boody asked	1.1617274079423625
M Guinness s	21.840993118326033
Bad cess to her big face	949.4860105710369

Katey went to the range and peered with squinting eyes	4931.907717140106
What s in the pot	263.1928479388765
she asked	1.1617274079423625
Shirts Maggy said	21.840993118326033
Boody cried angrily Crickey is there nothing for us to eat	7317.42647154861
Katey lifting the kettlelid in a pad of her stained skirt asked And what s in this	599.4842503189408
A heavy fume gushed in answer	949.4860105710369
Peasoup Maggy said	21.840993118326033
Where did you get it	331.46623639848457
Katey asked	1.1617274079423625
Sister Mary Patrick Maggy said	410.6204064167453
The lacquey rang his bell	293.6400269933979
Barang	1.1617274079423625
Boody sat down at the table and said hungrily Give us it here	3727.5937203149383
Maggy poured yellow thick soup from the kettle into a bowl	7719.846677868277
Katey sitting opposite Boody said quietly as her fingertip lifted to her mouth random crumbs A good job we have that much	149.24955450518294
Where s Dilly	21.840993118326033
Gone to meet father Maggy said	949.4860105710369
Boody breaking big chunks of bread into the yellow soup added Our father who art not in heaven	428.1332398719392
Maggy pouring yellow soup in Katey s bowl exclaimed Boody	5912.555183224002
For shame	1.1617274079423625
A skiff a crumpled throwaway Elijah is coming rode lightly down the Liffey under Loopline bridge shooting the rapids where water chafed around the bridgepiers sailing eastward past hulls and anchorchains between the Customhouse old dock and George s quay	16.57723885589317
The blond girl in Thornton s bedded the wicker basket with rustling fibre	3727.5937203149383
Blazes Boylan handed her the bottle swathed in pink tissue paper and a small jar	1333.521432163324

She bestowed fat pears neatly head by tail and among them ripe shamefaced peaches	2154.4346900318833

A young pullet	21.840993118326033
He took a red carnation from the tall stemglass	3889.346285241056

Two carfuls of tourists passed slowly their women sitting fore gripping the handrests	3727.5937203149383
Palefaces	1.1617274079423625
Men s arms frankly round their stunted forms	2903.2601932065677

Human eyes	1.1617274079423625
They gazed curiously an instant and turned quickly towards a Dalkey tram	7017.038286703832
Eccolo Almidano Artifoni said in friendly haste	1573.62613429214

Tante belle cose Almidano Artifoni holding up a baton of rolled music as a signal trotted on stout trousers after the Dalkey tram	121.15276586285881

The drain you mean	126.99109556487812
Drain	1.1617274079423625
Lenehan said	1.1617274079423625
It was down a manhole	410.6204064167453
They passed Dan Lowry s musichall where Marie Kendall charming soubrette smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile	240.40991835099712
Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M Coy how the whole thing was	240.40991835099712
One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it half choked with sewer gas	121.15276586285881
Down went Tom Rochford anyhow booky s vest and all with the rope round him	1333.521432163324

While he waited in Temple bar M Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter	100.00000000000001
The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade	2154.4346900318833

Through here	1.1617274079423625

There were fine plates in it worth double the money the stars and the moon and comets with long tails	240.40991835099712
Astronomy it was about	111.05117566129712
Lenehan laughed	1.1617274079423625
I ll tell you a damn good one about comets tails he said	3727.5937203149383
Come over in the sun	269.1738343049393

A card reappeared on the windowsash of number Eccles street	5562.856855515288
He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh	3727.5937203149383
Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher	3727.5937203149383
Bloom and the wife were there	787.0887026711796
Lashings of stuff we put up port wine and sherry and curacoa to which we did ample justice	428.1332398719392
Fast and furious it was	410.6204064167453
After liquids came solids	126.99109556487812
Cold joints galore and mince pies	949.4860105710369
I know M Coy said	238.0829320325612
The year the missus was there	862.742811655988
Lenehan linked his arm warmly	367.1967010491309
But wait till I tell you he said	1411.7907297467953
We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o clock the morning after the night before	71.09709432312432
Coming home it was a gorgeous winter s night on the Featherbed Mountain	3727.5937203149383
Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other	240.40991835099712
We started singing glees and duets the early beam of	5912.555183224002
She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt s port under her bellyband	1333.521432163324
Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me	3727.5937203149383
Hell s delights	21.840993118326033
She has a fine pair God bless her	2475.298852735907
Like that	1.1617274079423625
He held his caved hands a cubit from him frowning I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time	100.00000000000001
Know what I mean	95.84239688095921
His hands moulded ample curves of air	1780.428763062773
He shut his eyes tight in delight his body shrinking and blew a sweet chirp from his lips	428.1332398719392
The lad stood to attention anyhow he said with a sigh	5954.2958292038975
She s a gamey mare and no mistake	2517.0111453154045
Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey the great bear and Hercules and the dragon and the whole jingbang lot	32.74549162877729
But by God I was lost so to speak in the milky way	3727.5937203149383
He knows them all faith	367.1967010491309
At last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away	5912.555183224002
what star is that Poldy says she	1780.428763062773
one is it says Chris Callinan that s only what you might call a pinprick By God he wasn t far wide of the mark	83.76776400682921
Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall panting with soft laughter	7300.251061821653
I m weak he gasped	410.6204064167453
M Coy s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave	3727.5937203149383
Lenehan walked on again	111.05117566129712
He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly	3819.0776392223156
He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M Coy	4293.13994636419
He s a cultured allroundman Bloom is he said seriously	4586.590144691032
He s not one of your common or garden	3487.7246374995248
you know	1.1617274079423625
There s a touch of the artist about old Bloom	4406.485630497979
Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of Awful Disclosures of Maria then of Aristotle s Crooked botched print	428.1332398719392
Plates infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows	2154.4346900318833

The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter	3647.3399415562467
Them are two good ones he said	1780.428763062773
Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth	3727.5937203149383
He bent to make a bundle of the other books hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain	100.00000000000001
On O Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni professor of dancing c	149.24955450518294
Mr Bloom alone looked at the titles	1618.137084703284

The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint	1333.521432163324
An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly	2154.4346900318833
Mr Bloom read again beautiful woman Warmth showered gently over him cowing his flesh	2154.4346900318833
Flesh yielded amply amid rumpled clothes whites of eyes swooning up	7719.846677868277

Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop bulging out the dingy curtains	3727.5937203149383
The shopman s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face coughing	2154.4346900318833
He raked his throat rudely puked phlegm on the floor	4862.436084959862
He put his boot on what he had spat wiping his sole along it and bent showing a rawskinned crown scantily haired	149.24955450518294
Mr Bloom beheld it	126.99109556487812

He halted near his daughter	410.6204064167453
It s time for you she said	1780.428763062773

Dilly followed quickly and pulled his coat	1637.2623817614965
Well what is it	100.49400469796984
he said stopping	21.840993118326033
The lacquey rang his bell behind their backs	2321.680448289125
Barang	1.1617274079423625
Curse your bloody blatant soul Mr Dedalus cried turning on him	7317.42647154861
The lacquey aware of comment shook the lolling clapper of his bell but feebly Bang	1333.521432163324
Mr Dedalus stared at him	368.9265519088789
Watch him he said	108.9829112695572
It s instructive	21.840993118326033

He drew forth a handful of copper coins nervously	3889.346285241056
Can t you look for some money somewhere	2703.245875619065
Dilly said	1.1617274079423625

I looked all along the gutter in O Connell street	4882.384603483692

You re very funny Dilly said grinning	1637.2623817614965
Get a glass of milk for yourself and a bun or a something	3727.5937203149383
He put the other coins in his pocket and started to walk on	3727.5937203149383
The viceregal cavalcade passed greeted by obsequious policemen out of Parkgate	7300.251061821653
I m sure you have another shilling Dilly said	3429.448668844506
The lacquey banged loudly	126.99109556487812
Mr Dedalus amid the din walked off murmuring to himself with a pursing mincing mouth gently The little nuns	316.227766016838

Got round him all right	410.6204064167453

Men trampling down women and children	851.2348218321658

Most scandalous revelation	21.840993118326033
Not a single lifeboat would float and the firehose all burst	7719.846677868277
What I can t understand is how the inspectors ever allowed a boat like that	1333.521432163324

Hello Simon Father Cowley said	239.52926077343417
How are things	18.60036465451084
Hello Bob old man Mr Dedalus answered stopping	1837.3121765262147
They clasped hands loudly outside Reddy and Daughter s	4293.13994636419
Father Cowley brushed his moustache often downward with a scooping hand	6903.461660503397
Mr Dedalus said	9.547205150025563
Why then not much Father Cowley said	1462.1519118532806
I m barricaded up Simon with two men prowling around the house trying to effect an entrance	599.4842503189408
Jolly Mr Dedalus said	65.50227260336543
Who is it	21.840993118326033
O Father Cowley said	92.6663167884799
A certain gombeen man of our acquaintance	1780.428763062773
Mr Dedalus asked	16.30162829280214
The same Simon Father Cowley answered	824.5274024412339
Reuben of that ilk	111.05117566129712
I m just waiting for Ben Dollard	1637.2623817614965
He s going to say a word to long John to get him to take those two men off	316.227766016838
All I want is a little time	1643.043796432458
He looked with vague hope up and down the quay a big apple bulging in his neck	599.4842503189408
I know Mr Dedalus said nodding	490.5174516154846
Poor old bockedy Ben	126.99109556487812
He s always doing a good turn for someone	4014.671278934556
Hold hard	1.1617274079423625
There he is by God he said arse and pockets	4368.01988030761
Ben Dollard s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge	149.24955450518294
As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted Hold that fellow with the bad trousers	2154.4346900318833
Hold him now Ben Dollard said	714.0398318352517
Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard s figure	2154.4346900318833
Then turning to Father Cowley with a nod he muttered sneeringly That s a pretty garment isn t it for a summer s day	100.00000000000001
Why God eternally curse your soul Ben Dollard growled furiously I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw	149.24955450518294
He stood beside them beaming on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff saying They were made for a man in his health Ben anyhow	29.552092352028872
Bad luck to the jewman that made them Ben Dollard said	6537.500951083793
Thanks be to God he s not paid yet	2987.7289154230466
Father Cowley asked	21.840993118326033
Cashel Boyle O Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell murmuring glassyeyed strode past the Kildare street club	1333.521432163324
Ben Dollard frowned and making suddenly a chanter s mouth gave forth a deep note	1333.521432163324
Aw	1.1617274079423625
he said	1.1617274079423625
That s the style Mr Dedalus said nodding to its drone	4346.918950391322
What about that	18.040717293319346
Ben Dollard said	15.685352704529745
Not too dusty	21.840993118326033
What	1.1617274079423625
He turned to both	97.44303345634985
That ll do Father Cowley said nodding also	2238.5163682144193
The reverend Hugh C	97.6612821940667
Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint Mary s abbey past James and Charles Kennedy s rectifiers attended by Geraldines tall and personable towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of hurdles	32.74549162877729
Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward his joyful fingers in the air	428.1332398719392
Come along with me to the subsheriff s office he said	5546.570581550593
I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff	3727.5937203149383
He s a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun	2286.089651750046
He s well worth seeing mind you	1505.608178403045
Come along	1.1617274079423625
I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don t	149.24955450518294
Wait awhile	1.1617274079423625
We re on the right lay Bob believe you me	4640.209825509239
For a few days tell him Father Cowley said anxiously	4820.506993370702
Ben Dollard halted and stared his loud orifice open a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright	26.826957952797255
What few days	21.840993118326033
he boomed	1.1617274079423625
Hasn t your landlord distrained for rent	1780.428763062773
He has Father Cowley said	315.78952605321376
Then our friend s writ is not worth the paper it s printed on Ben Dollard said	599.4842503189408
The landlord has the prior claim	712.3065003413022
I gave him all the particulars	633.8737824779394
Windsor avenue	1.1617274079423625
That s right Father Cowley said	658.3458710431979
The reverend Mr Love	126.99109556487812
He s a minister in the country somewhere	2099.8878979449178
But are you sure of that	783.9243030199358
You can tell Barabbas from me Ben Dollard said that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts	240.40991835099712
He led Father Cowley boldly forward linked to his bulk	5912.555183224002
Filberts I believe they were Mr Dedalus said as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront following them	428.1332398719392
The youngster will be all right Martin Cunningham said as they passed out of the Castleyard gate	599.4842503189408
The policeman touched his forehead	410.6204064167453
God bless you Martin Cunningham said cheerily	1233.8555092857132
He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street	428.1332398719392
Bronze by gold Miss Kennedy s head by Miss Douce s head appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel	240.40991835099712
Yes Martin Cunningham said fingering his beard	1233.8555092857132
I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him	7017.038286703832
You could try our friend Mr Power suggested backward	4293.13994636419
Boyd	1.1617274079423625
Martin Cunningham said shortly	70.62472901622768
Touch me not	21.840993118326033
John Wyse Nolan lagging behind reading the list came after them quickly down Cork hill	1333.521432163324
On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti descending hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending	428.1332398719392
The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street	4293.13994636419
Look here Martin John Wyse Nolan said overtaking them at the office	7017.038286703832
I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings	5247.276053407287
Quite right Martin Cunningham said taking the list	1811.171887868484
And put down the five shillings too	1780.428763062773
Without a second word either Mr Power said	2230.1058582625474
Strange but true Martin Cunningham added	862.742811655988
John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes	711.7465568061971
I ll say there is much kindness in the jew he quoted elegantly	3727.5937203149383
They went down Parliament street	410.6204064167453
There s Jimmy Henry Mr Power said just heading for Kavanagh s	7017.038286703832
Righto Martin Cunningham said	70.62472901622768
Here goes	1.1617274079423625
Outside Maison Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney s brother in law humpy tight making for the liberties	599.4842503189408
John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit who walked uncertainly with hasty steps past Micky Anderson s watches	22.456979955397745
The assistant town clerk s corns are giving him some trouble John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power	599.4842503189408
They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh s winerooms	4820.506993370702
The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate	7719.846677868277
Martin Cunningham speaking always showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance	1333.521432163324
And long John Fanning is here too John Wyse Nolan said as large as life	1333.521432163324
The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood	3727.5937203149383
Good day Mr Subsheriff Martin Cunningham said as all halted and greeted	6963.177984956014
Long John Fanning made no way for them	2475.298852735907
Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations	2903.2601932065677
he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk	5965.479562217447
Hell open to christians they were having Jimmy Henry said pettishly about their damned Irish language	873.3261623828432
Where was the marshal he wanted to know to keep order in the council chamber	1333.521432163324
And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma no mace on the table nothing in order no quorum even and Hutchinson the lord mayor in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing for him	26.826957952797255
Damned Irish language language of our forefathers	1780.428763062773
Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips	6492.5399100633085
Martin Cunningham spoke by turns twirling the peak of his beard to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff while John Wyse Nolan held his peace	71.09709432312432
What Dignam was that	126.99109556487812
long John Fanning asked	100.49400469796984
Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot	5912.555183224002
O my corns	21.840993118326033
he said plaintively	21.840993118326033
Come upstairs for goodness sake till I sit down somewhere	5562.856855515288
Uff	1.1617274079423625
Ooo	1.1617274079423625
Mind	1.1617274079423625
Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning s flank and passed in and up the stairs	316.227766016838
Come on up Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff	2504.6642146535855
I don t think you knew him or perhaps you did though	6676.788472766662
With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in	3508.8177301592364
Decent little soul he was Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror	100.00000000000001
Rather lowsized	1.1617274079423625
Dignam of Menton s office that was Martin Cunningham said	3974.510413001878
Long John Fanning could not remember him	1618.1370847032842
Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air	1618.137084703284
What s that	13.70798079421585
Martin Cunningham said	10.489427551289968
All turned where they stood	410.6204064167453
John Wyse Nolan came down again	711.7465568061971
From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering	187.38174228603845
Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes not quickly	7300.251061821653
In saddles of the leaders leaping leaders rode outriders	4293.13994636419
What was it	18.60036465451084
Martin Cunningham asked as they went on up the staircase	4352.350513210658
The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot	1333.521432163324
As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines Parnell s brother	428.1332398719392
There in the corner	94.87513479536453
They chose a small table near the window opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard	149.24955450518294
Is that he	21.840993118326033
Haines asked twisting round in his seat	1505.608178403045
Yes Mulligan said	21.840993118326033
That s John Howard his brother our city marshal	4293.13994636419
John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested	187.38174228603845
An instant after under its screen his eyes looked quickly ghostbright at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner	149.24955450518294
I ll take a Haines said to the waitress	2903.001876627092
Two Buck Mulligan said	76.16021387784333
And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well	7017.038286703832
When she had gone he said laughing We call it D B C	3727.5937203149383
because they have damn bad cakes	949.4860105710369
O but you missed Dedalus on Haines opened his newbought book	7719.846677868277
I m sorry he said	368.9265519088789
Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance	3727.5937203149383
Buck Mulligan s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter	5123.53892068312
You should see him he said when his body loses its balance	7017.038286703832
Wandering Ængus I call him	367.1967010491309
I am sure he has an fixe Haines said pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger	599.4842503189408
Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be	6295.842833519821
Such persons always have	126.99109556487812
Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely	1510.9247026866935
They drove his wits astray he said by visions of hell	7719.846677868277
He will never capture the Attic note	1637.2623817614965
The note of Swinburne of all poets the white death and the ruddy birth	2154.4346900318833
That is his tragedy	111.05117566129712
He can never be a poet	773.4676608087022
The joy of creation	126.99109556487812
Eternal punishment Haines said nodding curtly	949.4860105710369
I see	1.1617274079423625
I tackled him this morning on belief	1510.9247026866935
There was something on his mind I saw	2509.1370150228763
It s rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that	873.3261623828432
Buck Mulligan s watchful eyes saw the waitress come	3667.3246827145394
He helped her to unload her tray	1780.428763062773
He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth Haines said amid the cheerful cups	599.4842503189408
Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea	4293.13994636419
Does he write anything for your movement	1780.428763062773
He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream	7017.038286703832
Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith	1333.521432163324
He bit off a soft piece hungrily	1780.428763062773
Ten years he said chewing and laughing	1780.428763062773
He is going to write something in ten years	2894.827111408276
Seems a long way off Haines said thoughtfully lifting his spoon	7243.2890197195
He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup	7719.846677868277
This is real Irish cream I take it he said with forbearance	7017.038286703832
I don t want to be imposed on	1258.93607001978
Elijah skiff light crumpled throwaway sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers amid an archipelago of corks beyond new Wapping street past Benson s ferry and by the threemasted schooner from Bridgwater with bricks	24.484367468222267
Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street past Sewell s yard	5912.555183224002
Behind him Cashel Boyle O Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith s house and crossing walked along Merrion square	61.05402296585327
Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park	1333.521432163324
Cashel Boyle O Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner s cheerful windows then turned and strode back along Merrion square his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling	52.983169062837085
His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun	1410.5067031204699
With ratsteeth bared he muttered volui He strode on for Clare street grinding his fierce word	873.3261623828432
As he strode past Mr Bloom s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards having buffeted a thewless body	36.51741272548377
The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form	7317.42647154861
God s curse on you he said sourly whoever you are	5630.048294399658
Opposite Ruggy O Donohoe s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam pawing the pound and a half of Mangan s late Fehrenbach s porksteaks he had been sent for went along warm Wicklow street dawdling	29.552092352028872
It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney s	14.547578108480476
And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake jawing the whole blooming time and sighing	1333.521432163324
After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle courtdress milliner stopped him	7017.038286703832
He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their props	599.4842503189408
From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently	4293.13994636419
Myler Keogh Dublin s pet lamb will meet sergeantmajor Bennett the Portobello bruiser for a purse of fifty sovereigns	316.227766016838
Gob that d be a good pucking match to see	5562.856855515288
Myler Keogh that s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash	2154.4346900318833
Two bar entrance soldiers half price	949.4860105710369
I could easy do a bunk on ma	2903.2601932065677
Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned	3977.110094220475
That s me in mourning	367.1967010491309
When is it	21.840993118326033
May the twentysecond	21.840993118326033
Sure the blooming thing is all over	1780.428763062773
He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned his cap awry his collar sticking up	316.227766016838
Buttoning it down his chin lifted he saw the image of Marie Kendall charming soubrette beside the two puckers	316.227766016838
One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out	46.415888336127786
Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on	4293.13994636419
The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons	2903.2601932065677
One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week man	428.1332398719392
But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him dodging and all	240.40991835099712
In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time	20.691380811147894
No Sandymount tram	21.840993118326033
Master Dignam walked along Nassau street shifted the porksteaks to his other hand	3727.5937203149383
His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down	5233.841450267788
The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt blooming end to it	873.3261623828432
He met schoolboys with satchels	410.6204064167453
He met other schoolboys	126.99109556487812
Do they notice I m in mourning	1488.020769087348
Uncle Barney said he d get it into the paper tonight	6128.1416451694695
Then they ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa s name	428.1332398719392
His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye	100.00000000000001
The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs	149.24955450518294
Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend	121.15276586285881
A big coffin it was and high and heavylooking	3637.0691429269077

And with that he took the bloody old towser by the scruff of the neck and by Jesus he near throttled him	149.24955450518294
The figure seated on a large boulder at the foot of a round tower was that of a broadshouldered deepchested stronglimbed frankeyed redhaired freelyfreckled shaggybearded widemouthed largenosed longheaded deepvoiced barekneed brawnyhanded hairylegged ruddyfaced sinewyarmed hero	24.484367468222267
From shoulder to shoulder he measured several ells and his rocklike mountainous knees were covered as was likewise the rest of his body wherever visible with a strong growth of tawny prickly hair in hue and toughness similar to the mountain gorse	14.547578108480476
The widewinged nostrils from which bristles of the same tawny hue projected were of such capaciousness that within their cavernous obscurity the fieldlark might easily have lodged her nest	46.415888336127786
The eyes in which a tear and a smile strove ever for the mastery were of the dimensions of a goodsized cauliflower	149.24955450518294
A powerful current of warm breath issued at regular intervals from the profound cavity of his mouth while in rhythmic resonance the loud strong hale reverberations of his formidable heart thundered rumblingly causing the ground the summit of the lofty tower and the still loftier walls of the cave to vibrate and tremble	8.431909292866257
He wore a long unsleeved garment of recently flayed oxhide reaching to the knees in a loose kilt and this was bound about his middle by a girdle of plaited straw and rushes	29.552092352028872
Beneath this he wore trews of deerskin roughly stitched with gut	7719.846677868277
His nether extremities were encased in high Balbriggan buskins dyed in lichen purple the feet being shod with brogues of salted cowhide laced with the windpipe of the same beast	41.011270705513006

A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone	6.218001087320917

Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus	83.76776400682921
Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels	14.547578108480476
In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them	12.91549665014884
Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā ālāvātār hātākāldā wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature	7.038135554931555
Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief	3727.5937203149383
Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power	9.55855309468529
It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was greet you friends of earth who are still in the body	36.51741272548377

Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction	316.227766016838
He is gone from mortal haunts O Dignam sun of our morning	7017.038286703832

I beg your parsnips says Alf	866.2253711860347

Ah well says Alf trying to pass it off	3754.265101828748
He s over all his troubles	949.4860105710369
But Bob Doran shouts out of him	1177.5919369159826
He s a bloody ruffian I say to take away poor little Willy Dignam	2154.4346900318833
Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet that they didn t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises	83.76776400682921
And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam true as you re there	1333.521432163324

The noblest the truest says he	949.4860105710369
And he s gone poor little Willy poor little Paddy Dignam	5979.514635097982
And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven	873.3261623828432
Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door	3727.5937203149383
Come in come on he won t eat you says the citizen	6382.334923819883
So Bloom slopes in with his cod s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there	240.40991835099712
O Christ M Keown says Joe reading one of the letters	6042.693406641836

Here says he take them to hell out of my sight Alf	7017.038286703832
Hello Bloom says he what will you have	2328.966305632901
So they started arguing about the point Bloom saying he wouldn t and he couldn t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he d just take a cigar	22.456979955397745
Gob he s a prudent member and no mistake	3420.3919305804416
Give us one of your prime stinkers Terry says Joe	4894.91706174508
And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it	240.40991835099712
They re all barbers says he from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses	121.15276586285881
And he was telling us there s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull	13.68874509537081
In the dark land they bide the vengeful knights of the razor	7017.038286703832
Their deadly coil they grasp yea and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord	32.74549162877729
So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on	5.30441727984393

He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker	187.38174228603845
Ruling passion strong in death says Joe as someone said	5562.856855515288
That can be explained by science says Bloom	2903.2601932065677
It s only a natural phenomenon don t you see because on account of the	1333.521432163324
And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon	428.1332398719392
The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would according to the best approved tradition of medical science be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus thereby causing the elastic pores of the to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this that and the other	1.8329807108324359

Time they were stopping up in the pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk	4.548777947003777

The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries banzai eljen zivio chinchin polla kronia hiphip vive amid which the ringing of the delegate of the land of song a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers was easily distinguishable	4.142704447847673
It was exactly seventeen o clock	949.4860105710369
The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared the commendatore s patriarchal sombrero which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi being removed by his medical adviser in attendance Dr Pippi	11.006941712522094

Hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously	41.011270705513006
As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office	13.68874509537081
On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers Messrs John Round and Sons Sheffield a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum colon blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim	5.30441727984393

Quite an excellent repast consisting of rashers and eggs fried steak and onions done to a nicety delicious hot breakfast rolls and invigorating tea had been considerately provided by the authorities for the consumption of the central figure of the tragedy who was in capital spirits when prepared for death and evinced the keenest interest in the proceedings from beginning to end but he with an abnegation rare in these our times rose nobly to the occasion and expressed the dying wish immediately acceded to that the meal should be divided in aliquot parts among the members of the sick and indigent roomkeepers association as a token of his regard and esteem	2.7699879264343568

She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and oblivious of the dreadful present they both laughed heartily all the spectators including the venerable pastor joining in the general merriment	8.778013135972484
That monster audience simply rocked with delight	1780.428763062773
But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time	1333.521432163324
A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people touched to the inmost core broke into heartrending sobs not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself	26.826957952797255
Big strong men officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage	17.782794100389232
A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex stepped forward and presenting his visiting card bankbook and genealogical tree solicited the hand of the hapless young lady requesting her to name the day and was accepted on the spot	9.55855309468529
Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion and when the gallant young Oxonian the bearer by the way of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion s history placed on the finger of his blushing an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds	3.9376589235643866
Nay even the stern provostmarshal lieutenantcolonel Tomkin Maxwell ffrenchmullan Tomlinson who presided on the sad occasion he who had blown a considerable number of sepoys from the cannonmouth without flinching could not now restrain his natural emotion	20.691380811147894

Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry straight it does when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what s waiting for me down Limehouse way	41.011270705513006
So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can t speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink the curse of Ireland	4.840960141478948
Antitreating is about the size of it	1488.020769087348
Gob he d let you pour all manner of drink down his throat till the Lord would call him before you d ever see the froth of his pint	46.415888336127786

Ireland sober is Ireland free	410.6204064167453
And then an old fellow starts blowing into his bagpipes and all the gougers shuffling their feet to the tune the old cow died of	83.76776400682921
And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females hitting below the belt	121.15276586285881
So howandever as I was saying the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me	187.38174228603845
I d train him by kindness so I would if he was my dog	2154.4346900318833
Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn t blind him	1333.521432163324
Afraid he ll bite you	410.6204064167453
says the citizen jeering	65.24838018230956
No says I	21.840993118326033
But he might take my leg for a lamppost	4293.13994636419
So he calls the old dog over	1488.020769087348
What s on you Garry	328.36511569890223
says he	1.1617274079423625
Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling letting on to answer like a duet in the opera	61.05402296585327
Such growling you never heard as they let off between them	7719.846677868277
Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter bono to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that	61.05402296585327
Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws	149.24955450518294
All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals and their name is legion should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry	6.40400427119728
Our greatest living phonetic expert wild horses shall not drag it from us has left no stone unturned in his efforts to delucidate and compare the verse recited and has found it bears a resemblance the italics are ours to the ranns of ancient Celtic bards	11.583232862547103

We subjoin a specimen which has been rendered into English by an eminent scholar whose name for the moment we are not at liberty to disclose though we believe that our readers will find the topical allusion rather more than an indication	14.547578108480476
The metrical system of the canine original which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught	20.691380811147894
Perhaps it should be added that the effect is greatly increased if Owen s verse be spoken somewhat slowly and indistinctly in a tone suggestive of suppressed rancour	52.983169062837085
The curse of my curses Seven days every day And seven dry Thursdays On you Barney Kiernan Has no sup of water To cool my courage And my guts red roaring After Lowry s lights	24.484367468222267
So he told Terry to bring some water for the dog and gob you could hear him lapping it up a mile off	121.15276586285881
Gob he s not as green as he s cabbagelooking	5014.346760775272

Entertainment for man and beast	410.6204064167453
And says Joe Could you make a hole in another pint	6919.7035378784885
Could a swim duck	126.99109556487812
says I	1.1617274079423625
Same again Terry says Joe	368.9265519088789
says he	1.1617274079423625
Thank you no says Bloom	410.6204064167453
As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham don t you see about this insurance of poor Dignam s	121.15276586285881
Martin asked me to go to the house	1600.0193211245298
You see he Dignam I mean didn t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can t recover on the policy	29.552092352028872
Holy Wars says Joe laughing that s a good one if old Shylock is landed	1333.521432163324
So the wife comes out top dog what	2903.2601932065677
Well that s a point says Bloom for the wife s admirers	7017.038286703832
Whose admirers	1.1617274079423625
says Joe	1.1617274079423625
The wife s advisers I mean says Bloom	2703.245875619065
Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act	4.548777947003777
He was bloody safe he wasn t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court	61.05402296585327

So Bob Doran comes lurching around asking Bloom to tell Mrs Dignam he was sorry for her trouble and he was very sorry about the funeral and to tell her that he said and everyone who knew him said that there was never a truer a finer than poor little Willy that s dead to tell her	7.2789538439831505
Choking with bloody foolery	126.99109556487812

Let me said he so far presume upon our acquaintance which however slight it may appear if judged by the standard of mere time is founded as I hope and believe on a sentiment of mutual esteem as to request of you this favour	12.91549665014884
But should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness	187.38174228603845
No rejoined the other I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that though the errand be one of sorrow this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup	9.152473108773892
Then suffer me to take your hand said he	4026.008396445538
The goodness of your heart I feel sure will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy were I to give vent to my feelings would deprive me even of speech	13.68874509537081
Boosed at five o clock	367.1967010491309
Night he was near being lagged only Paddy Leonard knew the bobby A	3727.5937203149383
Blind to the world up in a shebeen in Bride street after closing time fornicating with two shawls and a bully on guard drinking porter out of teacups	52.983169062837085
And the two shawls killed with the laughing picking his pockets the bloody fool and he spilling the porter all over the bed and the two shawls screeching laughing at one another	32.74549162877729
is your testament	21.840993118326033
Have you got an old testament Only Paddy was passing there I tell you what	1333.521432163324
Then see him of a Sunday with his little concubine of a wife and she wagging her tail up the aisle of the chapel with her patent boots on her no less and her violets nice as pie doing the little lady	14.547578108480476
Jack Mooney s sister	111.05117566129712
And the old prostitute of a mother procuring rooms to street couples	7017.038286703832
Gob Jack made him toe the line	1780.428763062773
Told him if he didn t patch up the pot Jesus he d kick the shite out of him	316.227766016838
So Terry brought the three pints	712.3065003413024
Here says Joe doing the honours	949.4860105710369
Here citizen	1.1617274079423625

The mimber	1.1617274079423625

Hairy Iopas says the citizen that exploded volcano the darling of all countries and the idol of his own	316.227766016838
So Joe starts telling the citizen about the foot and mouth disease and the cattle traders and taking action in the matter and the citizen sending them all to the rightabout and Bloom coming out with his sheepdip for the scab and a hoose drench for coughing calves and the guaranteed remedy for timber tongue	7.813707376518094
Because he was up one time in a knacker s yard	7719.846677868277

Perpetuating national hatred among nations	410.6204064167453
But do you know what a nation means	2002.790084782145

The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate in the course of a happy speech freely translated by the British chaplain the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible the volume of the word of God and the secret of England s greatness graciously presented to him by the white chief woman the great squaw Victoria with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor	3.0579958606136803
The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast and from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak surnamed Forty Warts after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors book subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks amid hilarious applause from the girl hands	5.179474679231211

You never saw the like of it in all your born puff	6952.064646045654
Gob if he got that lottery ticket on the side of his poll he d remember the gold cup he would so but begob the citizen would have been lagged for assault and battery and Joe for aiding and abetting	16.57723885589317
The jarvey saved his life by furious driving as sure as God made Moses	2154.4346900318833
What	1.1617274079423625
O Jesus he did	126.99109556487812
And he let a volley of oaths after him	4293.13994636419
And he shouting to the bloody dog After him Garry	5562.856855515288
After him boy	21.840993118326033
And the last we saw was the bloody car rounding the corner and old sheepsface on it gesticulating and the bloody mongrel after it with his lugs back for all he was bloody well worth to tear him limb from limb	15.505157798326243
Hundred to five	18.469695921350887
Jesus he took the value of it out of him I promise you	3727.5937203149383
When lo there came about them all a great brightness and they beheld the chariot wherein He stood ascend to heaven	187.38174228603845
And they beheld Him in the chariot clothed upon in the glory of the brightness having raiment as of the sun fair as the moon and terrible that for awe they durst not look upon Him	22.456979955397745
And there came a voice out of heaven calling	3754.265101828748
Elijah And He answered with a main cry	2703.245875619065
Adonai And they beheld Him even Him ben Bloom Elijah amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of fortyfive degrees over Donohoe s in Little Green street like a shot off a shovel	16.57723885589317
The summer evening had begun to fold the world in its mysterious embrace	3727.5937203149383
Far away in the west the sun was setting and the last glow of all too fleeting day lingered lovingly on sea and strand on the proud promontory of dear old Howth guarding as ever the waters of the bay on the weedgrown rocks along Sandymount shore and last but not least on the quiet church whence there streamed forth at times upon the stillness the voice of prayer to her who is in her pure radiance a beacon ever to the stormtossed heart of man Mary star of the sea	3.495250132675474
The three girl friends were seated on the rocks enjoying the evening scene and the air which was fresh but not too chilly	121.15276586285881
Many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey two little curlyheaded boys dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name	6.812920690579612
M	1.1617274079423625
S	1.1617274079423625
printed on both	21.840993118326033
For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them	26.826957952797255
They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets building castles as children do or playing with their big coloured ball happy as the day was long	46.415888336127786
And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight	149.24955450518294
He was but eleven months and nine days old and though still a tiny toddler was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words	100.00000000000001
Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin	316.227766016838
Now baby Cissy Caffrey said	367.1967010491309
Say out big big	126.99109556487812
And baby prattled after her A jink a jink a jawbo	7719.846677868277
Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on	7.813707376518094
What a persuasive power that girl had	1780.428763062773
But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib	240.40991835099712
None of your spoilt beauties Flora MacFlimsy sort was Cissy Caffrey	6919.703537878488
A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips a girl lovable in the extreme	32.74549162877729
And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother	7017.038286703832
But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky	2154.4346900318833
Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule	1333.521432163324
The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had	17.782794100389232
But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and true to the maxim that every little Irishman s house is his castle he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and alas to relate the coveted castle too	9.55855309468529
Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends	873.3261623828432
Come here Tommy his sister called imperatively	1780.428763062773
At once	1.1617274079423625
And you Jacky for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand	3727.5937203149383
Wait till I catch you for that	1419.4772683741962
His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister s word was law with the twins	121.15276586285881
And in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure	6849.595667344242
His little man o war top and unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit	12.216773489967919
Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn t be far from him her eyes dancing in admonition	11.006941712522094
Nasty bold Jacky	21.840993118326033
she cried	1.1617274079423625
She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly What s your name	1333.521432163324
Butter and cream	21.840993118326033
Tell us who is your sweetheart spoke Edy Boardman	4293.13994636419
Is Cissy your sweetheart	126.99109556487812
Nao tearful Tommy said	126.99109556487812
Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart	410.6204064167453
Cissy queried	1.1617274079423625
Nao Tommy said	18.469695921350887
I know Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes	873.3261623828432
I know who is Tommy s sweetheart	1389.4294614335427
Gerty is Tommy s sweetheart	328.36511569890223
Nao Tommy said on the verge of tears	2336.2750273279153
But who was Gerty	126.99109556487812
Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions lost in thought gazing far away into the distance was in very truth as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see	24.484367468222267
She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though as folks often said she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell	149.24955450518294
Her figure was slight and graceful inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling	8.778013135972484
The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid s bow Greekly perfect	83.76776400682921
Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either	14.547578108480476
Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman a deliberate lie when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she d never speak to her again	5.722367659350217
No	1.1617274079423625
Honour where honour is due	410.6204064167453
There was an innate refinement a languid queenly about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep	187.38174228603845
Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her	5.0608719869196825
Mayhap it was this the love that might have been that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look tense with suppressed meaning that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes a charm few could resist	17.782794100389232
Why have women such eyes of witchery	1780.428763062773
Gerty s were of the bluest Irish blue set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows	599.4842503189408
Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive	5912.555183224002
It was Madame Vera Verity directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes so becoming in leaders of fashion and she had never regretted it	13.68874509537081
Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose	121.15276586285881
But Gerty s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair	7719.846677868277
It was dark brown with a natural wave in it	5912.555183224002
She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too Thursday for wealth	26.826957952797255
And just now at Edy s words as a telltale flush delicate as the faintest rosebloom crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal	12.91549665014884
For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes	7719.846677868277
She was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue	3727.5937203149383
Inclination prompted her to speak out dignity told her to be silent	7017.038286703832
The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning	41.011270705513006
She knew right well no one better what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers quarrel	61.05402296585327
As per usual somebody s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window	32.74549162877729
Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W	11.583232862547103
E	1.1617274079423625
Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university	7017.038286703832
Little recked he perhaps for what she felt that dull aching void in her heart sometimes piercing to the core	240.40991835099712
Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time	2154.4346900318833
They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph	100.00000000000001
But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked every inch a gentleman the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden	2.875514727952744
Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out	46.415888336127786
She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone	32.74549162877729
All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery s summer sales the very it slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice seven fingers two and a penny	16.57723885589317
She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her	41.011270705513006
And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew	71.09709432312432
Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell a five and never would ash oak or elm with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep	11.583232862547103
Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops	29.552092352028872
As for undies they were Gerty s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen though Gerty would never see seventeen again can find it in his heart to blame her	20.691380811147894
She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery three garments and nighties extra and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons rosepink pale blue mauve and peagreen and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn t trust those washerwomen as far as she d see them scorching the things	4.738879609717654
She was wearing the blue for luck hoping against hope her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn t of a Friday	2.745342233838714
That strained look on her face	787.0887026711796
A gnawing sorrow is there all the time	2008.369134245829
Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where giving way to tears she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror	8.778013135972484
You are lovely Gerty it said	949.4860105710369
The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful	3727.5937203149383
Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain	410.6204064167453
Yes she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T	71.09709432312432
C	1.1617274079423625
D	1.1617274079423625
because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be	22.456979955397745
He was too young to understand	949.4860105710369
He would not believe in love a woman s birthright	4931.907717140106
The night of the party long ago in Stoer s he was still in short trousers when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips	24.484367468222267
He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss the first but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments	19.14481976169958
Impetuous fellow	1.1617274079423625
Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men	71.09709432312432
But waiting always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over	428.1332398719392
No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey and who would understand take her in his sheltering arms strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss	4.948168092155143
For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve	5912.555183224002
With all the heart of her she longs to be his only his affianced bride for riches for poor in sickness in health till death us two part from this to this day forward	26.826957952797255
And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be	41.011270705513006
Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face Bertha Supple too and Edy little spitfire because she would be twentytwo in November	61.05402296585327
She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess	83.76776400682921
Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses	2.2496381902251934
He would be tall with broad shoulders she had always admired tall men for a husband with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon three wonderful weeks and then when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house every morning they would both have brekky simple but perfectly served for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes	3.1992671377973836
Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight	15.505157798326243
But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground if you please	8.778013135972484
The temper of him	126.99109556487812
O he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies	873.3261623828432
Edy told him no no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him	121.15276586285881
You re not my sister naughty Tommy said	2666.78996584088
It s my ball	126.99109556487812
But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career having won the day	19.14481976169958
Anything for a quiet life laughed Ciss	1780.428763062773
And she tickled tiny tot s two cheeks to make him forget and played here s the lord mayor here s his two horses here s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in chinchopper chinchopper chinchopper chin	19.14481976169958
But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him	187.38174228603845
I d like to give him something she said so I would where I won t say	599.4842503189408
On the beeoteetom laughed Cissy merrily	949.4860105710369
Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she d be ashamed of her life to say flushing a deep rosy red and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said	10.0
But not a pin cared Ciss	949.4860105710369
Let him	1.1617274079423625
she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose	873.3261623828432
Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I d look at him	599.4842503189408
Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls	949.4860105710369
You had to laugh at her sometimes	1315.1822859664637
For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White	6.218001087320917
That was just like Cissycums	368.9265519088789
O and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road smoking a cigarette	32.74549162877729
There was none to come up to her for fun	4285.150604351929
But she was sincerity itself one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made not one of your twofaced things too sweet to be wholesome	71.09709432312432
And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ	316.227766016838
It was the men s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner the reverend John Hughes S	873.3261623828432
J rosary sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament	5912.555183224002
They were there gathered together without distinction of social class and a most edifying spectacle it was to see in that simple fane beside the waves after the storms of this weary world kneeling before the feet of the immaculate reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto beseeching her to intercede for them the old familiar words holy Mary holy virgin of virgins	5.878016072274914
How sad to poor Gerty s ears	1780.428763062773
Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson s Weekly she might now be rolling in her carriage second to none	20.691380811147894
Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket thinking	11.006941712522094
But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days	240.40991835099712
Nay she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father a prey to the fumes of intoxication forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low	4.948168092155143
And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful Virgin most merciful	1333.521432163324
And Gerty rapt in thought scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk	13.68874509537081
You never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose	6.40400427119728
With all his faults she loved him still when he sang me Mary how to woo or love and cottage near and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby s salad dressing for supper and when he sang moon hath with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried God have mercy on him from a stroke	7.038135554931555
Her mother s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken	26.826957952797255
No one would have thought the end was so near	5562.856855515288
Now he was laid to rest	949.4860105710369
And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby s cork lino artistic standard designs fit for a palace gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home	4.641588833612779
A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold	61.05402296585327
And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn t like her mother s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about taking snuff	11.006941712522094
Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways	5562.856855515288
It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer s christmas almanac the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window	4.142704447847673
You could see there was a story behind it	3150.8420175409037
The colours were done something lovely	949.4860105710369
She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat	121.15276586285881
She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant	7.038135554931555
The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks	12.91549665014884
Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball	29.552092352028872
Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please	83.76776400682921
The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty s skirt near the little pool by the rock	19.14481976169958
The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed	8.778013135972484
Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip	1780.428763062773
A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle	7.813707376518094
Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking	428.1332398719392
She felt the warm flush a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell surging and flaming into her cheeks	428.1332398719392
Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight wan and strangely drawn seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen	9.55855309468529
Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin spiritual vessel pray for us honourable vessel pray for us vessel of singular devotion pray for us mystical rose	11.006941712522094
And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary the most pious Virgin s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her	4.294487988789274
The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers	316.227766016838
Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till he crowed with glee clapping baby hands in air	873.3261623828432
Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah	71.09709432312432
and my word didn t the little chap enjoy that	5912.555183224002
Say papa baby	21.840993118326033
Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa	1515.5551566409292
And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health a perfect little bunch of love and he would certainly turn out to be something great they said	11.006941712522094
Haja ja ja haja	126.99109556487812
Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out holy saint Denis that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him	10.0
Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa	187.38174228603845
And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks	7719.846677868277
It was all no use soothering him with no nono baby no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss always readywitted gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased	12.91549665014884
Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves no hour to be out and the little brats of twins	36.51741272548377
She gazed out towards the distant sea	1643.043796432458
It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft	5.4361836201538365
And while she gazed her heart went pitapat	2903.2601932065677
Yes it was her he was looking at and there was meaning in his look	1333.521432163324
His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through read her very soul	428.1332398719392
Wonderful eyes they were superbly expressive but could you trust them	7719.846677868277
People were so queer	126.99109556487812
She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey the matinee idol only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly from where he was sitting	4.142704447847673
He was in deep mourning she could see that and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face	187.38174228603845
She would have given worlds to know what it was	4743.6291993820705
He was looking up so intently so still and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down	19.14481976169958
She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away	100.00000000000001
Here was that of which she had so often dreamed	4882.384603483692
It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no one else	61.05402296585327
The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him her dreamhusband because she knew on the instant it was him	187.38174228603845
If he had suffered more sinned against than sinning or even even if he had been himself a sinner a wicked man she cared not	83.76776400682921
Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her	428.1332398719392
There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm	2903.2601932065677
She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known those cyclists showing off what they hadn t got and she just yearned to know all to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her make him forget the memory of the past	9.152473108773892
Then mayhap he would embrace her gently like a real man crushing her soft body to him and love her his ownest girlie for herself alone	71.09709432312432
Refuge of sinners	21.840993118326033
Comfortress of the afflicted	126.99109556487812
pro	1.1617274079423625
Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart	13.68874509537081
Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church the stained glass windows lighted up the candles the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O Hanlon at the altar carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down	9.55855309468529
He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic	10.481131341546856
He told her that time when she told him about that in confession crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature s laws he said in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God he said and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word	3.495250132675474
He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place	3.2374575428176438
The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it	83.76776400682921
Little monkeys common as ditchwater	410.6204064167453
Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places the both of them	121.15276586285881
And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned	100.00000000000001
Jacky	1.1617274079423625
Tommy	1.1617274079423625
Not they	1.1617274079423625
What a great notion they had	949.4860105710369
So Cissy said it was the very last time she d ever bring them out	1333.521432163324
She jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn t get it to grow long because it wasn t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it	5.4361836201538365
She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible	3.6998304144069647
It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble	24.484367468222267
That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness	1333.521432163324
Queen of angels queen of patriarchs queen of prophets of all saints they prayed queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the gosa cramen	2.154434690031884
Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow s of George s street on the Tuesday no the Monday before Easter and there wasn t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at transparent and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form the cheek of her because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself	5.179474679231211
Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature	6.218001087320917
Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl s shoulders a radiant little vision in sooth almost maddening in its sweetness	15.505157798326243
You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that	240.40991835099712
She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve	240.40991835099712
She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes	32.74549162877729
He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey	5562.856855515288
Her woman s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose	20.691380811147894
Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty half smiling with her specs like an old maid pretending to nurse the baby	71.09709432312432
Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers	41.011270705513006
And she said to Gerty A penny for your thoughts	5562.856855515288
replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth	7243.2890197195
I was only wondering was it late	1618.1370847032842
And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy as glib as you like said it was half past kissing time time to kiss again	46.415888336127786
Wait said Cissy I ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what s the time by his conundrum	316.227766016838
So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket getting nervous and beginning to play with his watchchain looking up at the church	24.484367468222267
Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself	1333.521432163324
One moment he had been there fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure	29.552092352028872
His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones	71.09709432312432
Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order	240.40991835099712
Then they sang the second verse of the and Canon O Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time	4.3754793750741845
She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon	10.0
If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man s face	100.00000000000001
It is for you Gertrude MacDowell and you know it	5912.555183224002
Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out de coelo praestitisti and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over	2.2369194702482695
Gerty winced sharply	21.840993118326033
A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable	2154.4346900318833
It hurt O yes it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was	41.011270705513006
Gerty s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat so slim so flawless so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of	22.456979955397745
She had loved him better than he knew	2154.9702165079902
Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears	29.552092352028872
Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see	61.05402296585327
O responded Gerty quick as lightning laughing and the proud head flashed up	3727.5937203149383
I can throw my cap at who I like because it s leap year	2154.4346900318833
Her words rang out crystalclear more musical than the cooing of the ringdove but they cut the silence icily	316.227766016838
There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with	240.40991835099712
As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces	10.481131341546856
And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot	71.09709432312432
Miss puny little Edy s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it the little kinnatt because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof apart in another sphere that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it	3.4034148825183075
Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior	19.14481976169958
And Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky laughing up out of his gleeful eyes and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby without as much as by your leave sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib	5.4361836201538365
O my	1.1617274079423625
Puddeny pie	1.1617274079423625
protested Ciss	1.1617274079423625
He has his bib destroyed	410.6204064167453
The slight claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights	873.3261623828432
Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands	3.2769055017089728
How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight the last glimpse of Erin the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk hither thither with a tiny lost cry	12.91549665014884
And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book by Miss Cummins author of and other tales	3.75588809068008
For Gerty had her dreams that no one knew of	5233.841450267788
It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove the tortoiseshell combs her child of Mary badge the whiterose scent the eyebrowleine her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs	3.1992671377973836
thou real my ideal it was called by Louis J Walsh Magherafelt and after there was something about wilt thou ever and ofttimes the beauty of poetry so sad in its transient loveliness had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her one by one and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it	3.9376589235643866
But it must end she felt	949.4860105710369
If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her	599.4842503189408
Love laughs at locksmiths	126.99109556487812
She would make the great sacrifice	949.4860105710369
Her every effort would be to share his thoughts	4293.13994636419
Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness	873.3261623828432
There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse cruel only to be kind	8.778013135972484
But even if what then	410.6204064167453
Would it make a very great difference	1505.608178403045
From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled	6465.157402662053
She loathed that sort of person the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl s honour degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station	13.68874509537081
No no not that	126.99109556487812
They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess	61.05402296585327
Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall	873.3261623828432
She thought she understood	126.99109556487812
She would try to understand him because men were so different	7719.846677868277
The old love was waiting waiting with little white hands stretched out with blue appealing eyes	873.3261623828432
Heart of mine	21.840993118326033
She would follow her dream of love the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide	22.456979955397745
Nothing else mattered	21.840993118326033
Come what might she would be wild untrammelled free	4014.671278934556
Canon O Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang Dominum omnes and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out O look Cissy	7.2789538439831505
And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church blue and then green and purple	83.76776400682921
It s fireworks Cissy Caffrey said	862.742811655988
And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church helterskelter Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn t fall running	16.57723885589317
Come on Gerty Cissy called	410.6204064167453
It s the bazaar fireworks	301.0056161268702
But Gerty was adamant	126.99109556487812
She had no intention of being at their beck and call	7317.42647154861
If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was	316.227766016838
The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling	7300.251061821653
She looked at him a moment meeting his glance and a light broke in upon her	873.3261623828432
Whitehot passion was in that face passion silent as the grave and it had made her his	599.4842503189408
His hands and face were working and a tremour went over her	7017.038286703832
She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that supply soft and delicately rounded and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart his hoarse breathing because she knew too about the passion of men like that hotblooded because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed	2.2496381902251934
But this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips	20.691380811147894
Besides there was absolution so long as you didn t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too my dear and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did	4.460162165376301
And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look look there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air a soft thing to and fro dark	5.575305334261898
And she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees up up and in the tense hush they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it high high almost out of sight and her face was suffused with a divine an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too nainsook knickers the fabric that caresses the skin better than those other pettiwidth the green four and eleven on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn t ashamed and he wasn t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking looking	1.7731938603987991
She would fain have cried to him chokingly held out her snowy slender arms to him to come to feel his lips laid on her white brow the cry of a young girl s love a little strangled cry wrung from her that cry that has rung through the ages	9.55855309468529
And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O	7017.038286703832
then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O	3727.5937203149383
and everyone cried O	126.99109556487812
O	1.1617274079423625
they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden O so lovely O soft sweet soft	873.3261623828432
Then all melted away dewily in the grey air all was silent	7017.038286703832
Ah	1.1617274079423625
She glanced at him as she bent forward quickly a pathetic little glance of piteous protest of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl	71.09709432312432
He was leaning back against the rock behind	2903.2601932065677
Leopold Bloom for it is he stands silent with bowed head before those young guileless eyes	873.3261623828432
What a brute he had been	698.298020613788
At it again	21.840993118326033
A fair unsullied soul had called to him and wretch that he was how had he answered	599.4842503189408
An utter cad he had been	698.298020613788
He of all men	126.99109556487812
But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered	61.05402296585327
Should a girl tell	126.99109556487812
No a thousand times no	410.6204064167453
That was their secret only theirs alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don t tell	17.782794100389232
Cissy Caffrey whistled imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was and then she cried Gerty	121.15276586285881
Gerty	1.1617274079423625
We re going	21.840993118326033
Come on	1.1617274079423625
We can see from farther up	949.4860105710369
Gerty had an idea one of love s little ruses	5562.856855515288
Wonder if he s too far to	1389.4294614335427
She rose	1.1617274079423625
Was it goodbye	21.840993118326033
No	1.1617274079423625
She had to go but they would meet again there and she would dream of that till then tomorrow of her dream of yester eve	83.76776400682921
She drew herself up to her full height	2666.78996584088
Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart full of a strange shining hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face	61.05402296585327
She half smiled at him wanly a sweet forgiving smile a smile that verged on tears and then they parted	240.40991835099712
Slowly without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey to little baby Boardman	121.15276586285881
It was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed	428.1332398719392
She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because because Gerty MacDowell was	187.38174228603845
Tight boots	1.1617274079423625
No	1.1617274079423625
She s lame	21.840993118326033
O	1.1617274079423625
Mr Bloom watched her as she limped away	2475.298852735907
Poor girl	1.1617274079423625
That s why she s left on the shelf and the others did a sprint	1333.521432163324
Thought something was wrong by the cut of her jib	4936.9256881186975
Jilted beauty	1.1617274079423625
A defect is ten times worse in a woman	4014.671278934556
But makes them polite	126.99109556487812
Glad I didn t know it when she was on show	4865.688167579321
Hot little devil all the same	686.6466535110294
I wouldn t mind	89.02087655500138
Curiosity like a nun or a negress or a girl with glasses	7017.038286703832
That squinty one is delicate	410.6204064167453
Near her monthlies I expect makes them feel ticklish	4014.671278934556

That s the moon	80.67071427878827
But then why don t all women menstruate at the same time with the same moon I mean	428.1332398719392
Depends on the time they were born I suppose	3754.265101828748
Or all start scratch then get out of step	3889.346285241056
Anyhow I got the best of that	1488.020769087348
Damned glad I didn t do it in the bath this morning over her silly I will punish you letter	240.40991835099712

Bad plan however if you don t know how to end the conversation	3727.5937203149383

And kissed my hand when I gave her the extra two shillings	7017.038286703832
Parrots	1.1617274079423625
Press the button and the bird will squeak	2903.2601932065677
Wish she hadn t called me sir	1780.428763062773
O her mouth in the dark	655.1673340853641
And you a married man with a single girl	3637.0691429269077
That s what they enjoy	361.48876812228025
Taking a man from another woman	949.4860105710369
Different with me	21.840993118326033
Glad to get away from other chap s wife	4293.13994636419
Eating off his cold plate	410.6204064167453
Chap in the Burton today spitting back gumchewed gristle	3775.498542034942
Cause of half the trouble	410.6204064167453
But might happen sometime I don t think	1830.6848506124447
Come in all is prepared	410.6204064167453
I dreamt	1.1617274079423625
What	1.1617274079423625
Worst is beginning	21.840993118326033
How they change the venue when it s not what they like	7017.038286703832
Ask you do you like mushrooms because she once knew a gentleman who	3727.5937203149383
Or ask you what someone was going to say when he changed his mind and stopped	873.3261623828432
Yet if I went the whole hog say I want to something like that	2154.4346900318833
Because I did	21.840993118326033
She too	1.1617274079423625
Offend her	1.1617274079423625
Then make it up	111.05117566129712
Pretend to want something awfully then cry off for her sake	7300.251061821653
Flatters them	1.1617274079423625
She must have been thinking of someone else all the time	5191.804942990891
What harm	1.1617274079423625
Must since she came to the use of reason he he and he	3727.5937203149383
First kiss does the trick	367.1967010491309
The propitious moment	21.840993118326033
Something inside them goes pop	410.6204064167453
Mushy like tell by their eye on the sly	3729.642833208875
First thoughts are best	126.99109556487812
Remember that till their dying day	949.4860105710369
Fifteen she told me	104.22607962703682
But her breasts were developed	410.6204064167453
Fell asleep then	21.840993118326033
After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home	4014.671278934556
Featherbed mountain	1.1617274079423625
Gnashing her teeth in sleep	410.6204064167453
Lord mayor had his eye on her too	2903.2601932065677
Val Dillon	1.1617274079423625
Apoplectic	1.1617274079423625
There she is with them down there for the fireworks	5098.150581255056
My fireworks	1.1617274079423625
Up like a rocket down like a stick	2666.78996584088
And the children twins they must be waiting for something to happen	7017.038286703832
Want to be grownups	108.9829112695572
Dressing in mother s clothes	410.6204064167453
Time enough understand all the ways of the world	2843.225972242827
And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth	7017.038286703832
I knew she could whistle	410.6204064167453
Mouth made for that	126.99109556487812
Like Molly	1.1617274079423625
Why that highclass whore in Jammet s wore her veil only to her nose	2154.4346900318833
Would you mind please telling me the right time	3764.8668526744877
Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning cure for fat lips	7017.038286703832
Caressing the little boy too	410.6204064167453
Onlookers see most of the game	851.2348218321658
Of course they understand birds animals babies	1780.428763062773
In their line	21.840993118326033
Wouldn t give that satisfaction	410.6204064167453
Those girls those girls those lovely seaside girls	2168.516819432713
Fine eyes she had clear	410.6204064167453
It s the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil	1333.521432163324
Did she know what I	311.4593559728013
Course	1.1617274079423625
Like a cat sitting beyond a dog s jump	4293.13994636419
Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show	149.24955450518294
Call that innocence	21.840993118326033
Poor idiot	1.1617274079423625
His wife has her work cut out for her	4293.13994636419
Never see them sit on a bench marked	2903.2601932065677
Eyes all over them	126.99109556487812
Look under the bed for what s not there	4014.671278934556
Longing to get the fright of their lives	2366.257181795485
Sharp as needles they are	410.6204064167453
When I said to Molly the man at the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking thought she might like twigged at once he had a false arm	61.05402296585327
Had too	1.1617274079423625
Where do they get that	328.36511569890223
Typist going up Roger Greene s stairs two at a time to show her understandings	1333.521432163324
Handed down from father to mother to daughter I mean	5912.555183224002
Bred in the bone	108.9829112695572
Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing	3727.5937203149383
Best place for an ad to catch a woman s eye on a mirror	2154.4346900318833
Clever little minx	21.840993118326033
I never told her	126.99109556487812
Neat way she carries parcels too	949.4860105710369
Attract men small thing like that	711.7465568061971
Holding up her hand shaking it to let the blood flow back when it was red	873.3261623828432
Who did you learn that from	949.4860105710369
Nobody	1.1617274079423625
Something the nurse taught me	410.6204064167453
O don t they know	331.46623639848457
Three years old she was in front of Molly s dressingtable just before we left Lombard street west	428.1332398719392
Me have a nice pace	410.6204064167453
Mullingar	1.1617274079423625
Who knows	1.1617274079423625
Ways of the world	72.83601092661934
Young student	1.1617274079423625
Straight on her pins anyway not like the other	3754.265101828748
Still she was game	126.99109556487812
Lord I am wet	126.99109556487812
Devil you are	21.840993118326033
Swell of her calf	126.99109556487812
Transparent stockings stretched to breaking point	949.4860105710369
Not like that frump today	410.6204064167453
A	1.1617274079423625
E	1.1617274079423625
Rumpled stockings	1.1617274079423625
Or the one in Grafton street	783.9243030199358
White	1.1617274079423625
Wow	1.1617274079423625
Beef to the heel	111.05117566129712
A monkey puzzle rocket burst spluttering in darting crackles	4293.13994636419
Zrads and zrads zrads zrads	410.6204064167453
Will she	1.1617274079423625
Watch	1.1617274079423625
Watch	1.1617274079423625
See	1.1617274079423625
Looked round	1.1617274079423625
She smelt an onion	126.99109556487812
Darling I saw your	126.99109556487812
I saw all	21.840993118326033
Lord	1.1617274079423625
Did me good all the same	686.6466535110294
Off colour after Kiernan s Dignam s	1780.428763062773
For this relief much thanks	293.6400269933979
In that is	21.840993118326033
Lord	1.1617274079423625
It was all things combined	367.1967010491309
Excitement	1.1617274079423625
When she leaned back felt an ache at the butt of my tongue	3727.5937203149383
Your head it simply swirls	256.2755164346742
He s right	21.840993118326033
Might have made a worse fool of myself however	4014.671278934556
Instead of talking about nothing	410.6204064167453
Then I will tell you all	604.601255504899
Still it was a kind of language between us	2398.7059151005897
It couldn t be	126.99109556487812
No Gerty they called her	410.6204064167453
Might be false name however like my name and the address Dolphin s barn a blind	873.3261623828432
Her maiden name was Jemina Brown And she lived with her mother in Irishtown	2154.4346900318833
Place made me think of that I suppose	2161.732906691789
All tarred with the same brush	862.742811655988
Wiping pens in their stockings	410.6204064167453
But the ball rolled down to her as if it understood	6670.941311046164
Every bullet has its billet	410.6204064167453
Course I never could throw anything straight at school	4026.008396445538
Crooked as a ram s horn	949.4860105710369
Sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller s earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah	17.782794100389232
No soft job	21.840993118326033
Saves them	1.1617274079423625
Keeps them out of harm s way	1277.7037961367007
Nature	1.1617274079423625
Washing child washing corpse	126.99109556487812
Dignam	1.1617274079423625
Children s hands always round them	949.4860105710369
Cocoanut skulls monkeys not even closed at first sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds	873.3261623828432
Oughtn t to have given that child an empty teat to suck	7017.038286703832
Fill it up with wind	367.1967010491309
Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy	18.469695921350887
Must call to the hospital	328.36511569890223
Wonder is nurse Callan there still	949.4860105710369
She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace	2154.4346900318833
That young doctor O Hare I noticed her brushing his coat	7719.846677868277
And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too marriageable	7719.846677868277
Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms	3727.5937203149383
Husband rolling in drunk stink of pub off him like a polecat	7017.038286703832
Have that in your nose in the dark whiff of stale boose	7017.038286703832
Then ask in the morning was I drunk last night	4764.791535231487
Bad policy however to fault the husband	1780.428763062773
Chickens come home to roost	410.6204064167453
They stick by one another like glue	1780.428763062773
Maybe the women s fault also	862.742811655988
That s where Molly can knock spots off them	3977.110094220475
It s the blood of the south	879.8692695757785
Moorish	1.1617274079423625
Also the form the figure	410.6204064167453
Hands felt for the opulent	296.4131996673495
Just compare for instance those others	949.4860105710369
Wife locked up at home skeleton in the cupboard	4293.13994636419
Allow me to introduce my	410.6204064167453
Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript wouldn t know what to call her	599.4842503189408
Always see a fellow s weak point in his wife	5562.856855515288
Still there s destiny in it falling in love	4293.13994636419
Have their own secrets between them	949.4860105710369
Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn t take them in hand	873.3261623828432
Then little chits of girls height of a shilling in coppers with little hubbies	2154.4346900318833
As God made them he matched them	1637.2623817614965
Sometimes children turn out well enough	949.4860105710369
Twice nought makes one	126.99109556487812
Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride	4293.13994636419
Marry in May and repent in December	1780.428763062773
This wet is very unpleasant	410.6204064167453
Stuck	1.1617274079423625
Well the foreskin is not back	949.4860105710369
Better detach	1.1617274079423625
Ow	1.1617274079423625
Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket	7317.42647154861
Long and the short of it	949.4860105710369
Big he and little she	410.6204064167453
Wristwatches are always going wrong	410.6204064167453
Wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he	873.3261623828432
Yes I suppose at once	367.1967010491309
Cat s away the mice will play	1780.428763062773
I remember looking in Pill lane	949.4860105710369
Also that now is magnetism	410.6204064167453
Back of everything magnetism	126.99109556487812
Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled	2903.2601932065677
That causes movement	21.840993118326033
And time well that s the time the movement takes	4503.695017888783
Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit	3727.5937203149383
Because it s all arranged	348.29171113587296
Magnetic needle tells you what s going on in the sun the stars	3727.5937203149383
Little piece of steel iron	410.6204064167453
When you hold out the fork	949.4860105710369
Come	1.1617274079423625
Come	1.1617274079423625
Tip	1.1617274079423625
Woman and man that is	367.1967010491309
Fork and steel	21.840993118326033
Molly he	1.1617274079423625
Dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you re a man to see that and like a sneeze coming legs look look and if you have any guts in you	16.57723885589317
Tip	1.1617274079423625
Have to let fly	111.05117566129712
Wonder how is she feeling in that region	2903.2601932065677
Shame all put on before third person	1780.428763062773
More put out about a hole in her stocking	3764.8668526744877
Molly her underjaw stuck out head back about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show	316.227766016838
And when the painters were in Lombard street west	2755.0084702743134
Fine voice that fellow had	367.1967010491309
How Giuglini began	21.840993118326033
Smell that I did	126.99109556487812
Like flowers	1.1617274079423625
It was too	18.469695921350887
Violets	1.1617274079423625
Came from the turpentine probably in the paint	2903.2601932065677
Make their own use of everything	949.4860105710369
Same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn t hear	1333.521432163324
But lots of them can t kick the beam I think	7719.846677868277
Keep that thing up for hours	949.4860105710369
Kind of a general all round over me and half down my back	3727.5937203149383
Wait	1.1617274079423625
Hm	1.1617274079423625
Hm	1.1617274079423625
Yes	1.1617274079423625
That s her perfume	126.99109556487812
Why she waved her hand	410.6204064167453
I leave you this to think of me when I m far away on the pillow	873.3261623828432
What is it	13.189756861229219
Heliotrope	1.1617274079423625
No	1.1617274079423625
Hyacinth	1.1617274079423625
Hm	1.1617274079423625
Roses I think	21.840993118326033
She d like scent of that kind	1780.428763062773
Sweet and cheap soon sour	410.6204064167453
Why Molly likes opoponax	126.99109556487812
Suits her with a little jessamine mixed	1493.2751896377315
Her high notes and her low notes	1780.428763062773
At the dance night she met him dance of the hours	6528.238891300286
Heat brought it out	126.99109556487812
She was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before	2154.4346900318833
Good conductor is it	126.99109556487812
Or bad	1.1617274079423625
Light too	1.1617274079423625
Suppose there s some connection	410.6204064167453
For instance if you go into a cellar where it s dark	7017.038286703832
Mysterious thing too	21.840993118326033
Why did I smell it only now	1643.043796432458
Suppose it s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across	7017.038286703832
Yes it is	18.040717293319346
Because those spice islands Cinghalese this morning smell them leagues off	7719.846677868277
Tell you what it is	311.4593559728013
It s like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin fine like what do you call it gossamer and they re always spinning it out of them fine as anything like rainbow colours without knowing it	15.505157798326243
Clings to everything she takes off	949.4860105710369
Vamp of her stockings	126.99109556487812
Warm shoe	1.1617274079423625
Stays	1.1617274079423625
Drawers little kick taking them off	866.2253711860347
Byby till next time	126.99109556487812
Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed	7017.038286703832
Know her smell in a thousand	862.742811655988
Bathwater too	1.1617274079423625
Reminds me of strawberries and cream	787.0887026711796
Wonder where it is really	410.6204064167453
There or the armpits or under the neck	2903.2601932065677
Because you get it out of all holes and corners	4003.413933186481
Hyacinth perfume made of oil of ether or something	4293.13994636419
Muskrat	1.1617274079423625

In ward wary the watcher hearing come that man mildhearted eft rising with swire ywimpled to him her gate wide undid	187.38174228603845
Lo levin leaping lightens in eyeblink Ireland s westward welkin	5912.555183224002
Full she drad that God the Wreaker all mankind would fordo with water for his evil sins	599.4842503189408
Christ s rood made she on breastbone and him drew that he would rathe infare under her thatch	428.1332398719392
That man her will wotting worthful went in Horne s house	6449.303993850496
Loth to irk in Horne s hall hat holding the seeker stood	7017.038286703832
On her stow he ere was living with dear wife and lovesome daughter that then over land and seafloor nine years had long outwandered	100.00000000000001
Once her in townhithe meeting he to her bow had not doffed	7017.038286703832
Her to forgive now he craved with good ground of her allowed that that of him swiftseen face hers so young then had looked	100.00000000000001
Light swift her eyes kindled bloom of blushes his word winning	7719.846677868277
As her eyes then ongot his weeds swart therefor sorrow she feared	7017.038286703832
Glad after she was that ere adread was	2694.78913506113
Her he asked if O Hare Doctor tidings sent from far coast and she with grameful sigh him answered that O Hare Doctor in heaven was	71.09709432312432
Sad was the man that word to hear that him so heavied in bowels ruthful	1333.521432163324
All she there told him ruing death for friend so young algate sore unwilling God s rightwiseness to withsay	316.227766016838
She said that he had a fair sweet death through God His goodness with masspriest to be shriven holy housel and sick men s oil to his limbs	52.983169062837085
The man then right earnest asked the nun of which death the dead man was died and the nun answered him and said that he was died in Mona Island through bellycrab three year agone come Childermas and she prayed to God the Allruthful to have his dear soul in his undeathliness	8.778013135972484
So stood they there both awhile in wanhope sorrowing one with other	7017.038286703832
Therefore everyman look to that last end that is thy death and the dust that gripeth on every man that is born of woman for as he came naked forth from his mother s womb so naked shall he wend him at the last for to go as he came	9.55855309468529
The man that was come in to the house then spoke to the nursingwoman and he asked her how it fared with the woman that lay there in childbed	46.415888336127786
The nursingwoman answered him and said that that woman was in throes now full three days and that it would be a hard birth unneth to bear but that now in a little it would be	22.456979955397745
She said thereto that she had seen many births of women but never was none so hard as was that woman s birth	121.15276586285881
Then she set it all forth to him for because she knew the man that time was had lived nigh that house	149.24955450518294
The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid	9.55855309468529
Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless	949.4860105710369
And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat	71.09709432312432
And there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon	2154.4346900318833
And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice	4.294487988789274
And he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there	187.38174228603845
And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile	240.40991835099712
Also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility	61.05402296585327
But the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle	41.011270705513006
And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery	46.415888336127786
And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment	29.552092352028872
And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously	19.14481976169958
And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles	32.74549162877729
And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer	316.227766016838
And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so	17.782794100389232
And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress	61.05402296585327
And also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain	11.583232862547103
And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead	32.74549162877729
And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each	100.00000000000001
And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile	9.152473108773892
And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile	1333.521432163324
Thanked be Almighty God	126.99109556487812
This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child a gentle dame whose time hied fast	16.57723885589317
Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel said he that it be not come or now	26.826957952797255
Meseems it dureth overlong	126.99109556487812
And he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently	9.55855309468529
But said he or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long	52.983169062837085
And the franklin that had drunken said Expecting each moment to be her next	2154.4346900318833
Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and Now drink said he fully delectably and he quaffed as far as he might to their both s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness	9.152473108773892
And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup	7.813707376518094
Woman s woe with wonder pondering	949.4860105710369
Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might	316.227766016838
There was a sort of scholars along either side the board that is to wit Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden scholars of medicine and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa one Crotthers and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested and of all them reserved young Stephen he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead and beside the meek sir Leopold	3.0579958606136803
But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow	61.05402296585327
And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner	12.91549665014884
Ruth red him love led on with will to wander loth to leave	3727.5937203149383
For they were right witty scholars	949.4860105710369
And he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case	4.641588833612779
And they said farther she should live because in the beginning they said the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die	13.68874509537081
And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy	14.547578108480476
A redress God grant	126.99109556487812
This was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay by our Virgin Mother the wife should live and the babe to die	100.00000000000001
In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack	17.782794100389232
Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved	8.431909292866257
To whom young Stephen had these words following Murmur sirs is eke oft among lay folk	873.3261623828432
Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker the one in limbo gloom the other in purgefire	599.4842503189408
But gramercy what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise which is the sin against the Holy Ghost Very God Lord and Giver of Life	71.09709432312432
For sirs he said our lust is brief	2903.2601932065677
We are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we	873.3261623828432
Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends	7719.846677868277
But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead	12.91549665014884
Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn the other all this while pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do	5.722367659350217
Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever	12.216773489967919
Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom of law of canons of Lilith patron of abortions of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or as Virgilius saith by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses Maimonides	3.75588809068008
He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman s seal even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded	4.948168092155143
All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life	121.15276586285881
That is truth pardy said Dixon and or I err a pregnant word	3727.5937203149383
Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons	12.216773489967919
But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny	6.218001087320917
And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb s wool the flower of the flock lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled for it was then about the midst of the winter and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage for all accounted him of real parts so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores	2.4757157946593416
About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray	6.042963902381328
Now drink we quod he of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul s bodiment	71.09709432312432
Leave ye fraction of bread to them that live by bread alone	7017.038286703832
Be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay	599.4842503189408
See ye here	21.840993118326033
And he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had he said for a song which he writ	41.011270705513006
They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore	873.3261623828432
His words were then these as followeth Know all men he said time s ruins build eternity s mansions	316.227766016838
What means this	21.840993118326033

And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word	6637.602416935541
A pregnancy without joy he said a birth without pangs a body without blemish a belly without bigness	428.1332398719392
Let the lewd with faith and fervour worship	2694.78913506113

Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack first three months she was not well Staboo when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard	3.2769055017089728
It was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him a murrain seize the dolt what a devil he would be at thou chuff thou puny thou got in peasestraw thou losel thou chitterling thou spawn of a rebel thou dykedropt thou abortion thou to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape the good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet margerain gentle advising also the time s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred	2.212216291070449
In Horne s house rest should reign	1538.1684667290513
To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles goodly grinning asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days	8.778013135972484
Master Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how as he heard hereof counted he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too waxing merry and toasting to his fathership	10.0
But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin	187.38174228603845
Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses as the priests use in Madagascar island she to be in guise of white and saffron her groom in white and grain with burning of nard and tapers on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem novetur sexus omnis corporis till she was there unmaided	4.948168092155143
He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is in their s that was writ for a like twining of lovers bed to was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals	9.55855309468529
Well met they were said Master Dixon joyed but harkee young sir better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for by my troth of such a mingling much might come	36.51741272548377
Young Stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it	12.216773489967919

Came now the storm that hist his heart	2903.2601932065677
And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry	121.15276586285881
And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm	7.813707376518094
Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour	17.782794100389232
But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead	83.76776400682921

Why he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding which he had not done	240.40991835099712
For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show	29.552092352028872
And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away	3727.5937203149383
By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law	36.51741272548377
Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called Believe on Me that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it	8.11130830789687
Yes Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name she said is Bird in the Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as Ho you pretty man turn aside hither and I will show you a brave place and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two in the Bush or by some learned Carnal Concupiscence	2.99357729472049
This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird in the Hand which was within all foul plagues monsters and a wicked devil they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her	7.53690398089854
For regarding Believe on Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for first Two in the Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and second for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and third that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild	2.745342233838714

All the world saying for aught they knew the big wind of last February a year that did havoc the land so pitifully a small thing beside this barrenness	46.415888336127786
But by and by as said this evening after sundown the wind sitting in the west biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after past ten of the clock one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the pour came	3.4485331776221058

Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there that got in through pleading her belly and now on the stools poor body two days past her term the midwives sore put to it and can t deliver she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks they say but God give her soon issue	2.631286073895943

In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi s almanac and I hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer s gazette to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how	3.317671127842857
With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night s gazette and he made a show to find it about him for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it but on Stephen s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk	5.30441727984393
He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat	52.983169062837085
To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps ostlers bookies Paul s men runners flatcaps waistcoateers ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip	5.575305334261898
He took his ordinary at a boilingcook s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother s son of them would burst their sides	6.042963902381328
The other Costello that is hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale	1333.521432163324
Faith no he says Frank that was his name tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague	121.15276586285881
But they can go hang says he with a wink for me with their bully beef a pox on it	240.40991835099712
There s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset	8.431909292866257
aux says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too	46.415888336127786
From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father a headborough who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes	5.575305334261898
One time he would be a playactor then a sutler or a welsher then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk kidnapping a squire s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids linen or choking chicken behind a hedge	6.218001087320917
He had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him	19.14481976169958
What says Mr Leopold with his hands across that was earnest to know the drift of it will they slaughter all	187.38174228603845
I protest I saw them but this day morning going to the Liverpool boats says he	873.3261623828432
I can scarce believe tis so bad says he	4293.13994636419
And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers greasy hoggets and wether wool having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low s yard in Prussia street	9.55855309468529
I question with you there says he	1637.2623817614965
More like tis the hoose or the timber tongue	4293.13994636419
Mr Stephen a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns	7.813707376518094
Come come says Mr Vincent plain dealing	1538.1684667290513
He ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that s Irish says he	187.38174228603845
Irish by name and irish by nature says Mr Stephen and he sent the ale purling about an Irish bull in an English chinashop	100.00000000000001
I conceive you says Mr Dixon	773.4676608087022
It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas the bravest cattlebreeder of them all with an emerald ring in his nose	61.05402296585327
True for you says Mr Vincent cross the table and a bullseye into the bargain says he and a plumper and a portlier bull says he never shit on shamrock	41.011270705513006
He had horns galore a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island leaving doughballs and rollingpins followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains	17.782794100389232
What for that says Mr Dixon but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself	29.552092352028872
So be off now says he and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer s blessing and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly	32.74549162877729
But the slap and the blessing stood him friend says Mr Vincent for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid wife abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland	3.9376589235643866
Another then put in his word And they dressed him says he in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart s content	4.3754793750741845
By this time the father of the faithful for so they called him was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture	100.00000000000001
To remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls language and they all after him	8.778013135972484
Ay says another and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself for that was the only colour to his mind and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice saying By the Lord Harry Green is the grass that grows on the ground	5.4361836201538365
And says Mr Dixon if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry s orders	6.042963902381328
There was bad blood between them at first says Mr Vincent and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I ll meddle in his matters says he	12.216773489967919
I ll make that animal smell hell says he with the help of that good pizzle my father left me	240.40991835099712
But one evening says Mr Dixon when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans which is good bog Latin for boss of the show	3.2769055017089728
After that says Mr Vincent the lord Harry put his head into a cow s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name	26.826957952797255
Then with the water running off him he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat	3.317671127842857
In short he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt	316.227766016838
They were says Mr Stephen and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward as the ungrate women were all of one mind made a wherry raft loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard set all masts erect manned the yards sprang their luff heaved to spread three sheets in the wind put her head between wind and water weighed anchor ported her helm ran up the jolly Roger gave three times three let the bullgine run pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America	3.1264357272238157
Which was the occasion says Mr Vincent of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty Pope Peter s but a pissabed	121.15276586285881
Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on	24.484367468222267
Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell s bearing a legend printed in fair italics Malachi Mulligan	32.74549162877729
Fertiliser and Incubator	21.840993118326033
His project as he went on to expound was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed	10.0
Well let us hear of it good my friend said Mr Dixon	7017.038286703832
I make no doubt it smacks of wenching	2903.2601932065677
Come be seated both	126.99109556487812
Tis as cheap sitting as standing	949.4860105710369
Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and expatiating upon his design told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility both the inhibitory and the prohibitory whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired	5.30441727984393
It grieved him plaguily he said to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures a prey to the vilest bonzes who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress this he assured them made his heart weep	3.5938136638046276
To curb this inconvenient which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder lord Talbot de Malahide a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party	6.601948484081891
He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural	6.812920690579612
Money was no object he said nor would he take a penny for his pains	1333.521432163324
The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions would find in him their man	36.51741272548377
For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies	8.778013135972484
After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it	46.415888336127786
They both it seems had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water as might be observed by Mr Mulligan s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald	19.14481976169958
His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary s excepted to it asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle	17.782794100389232
Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which as it dwelt upon his memory seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi O quirites ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach the buck and doe of the forest glade the farmyard drake and duck	3.495250132675474
Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance being indeed a proper man of person this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced	11.006941712522094
The young gentleman his friend overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour	71.09709432312432
Mr Mulligan now perceiving the table asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and seeing the stranger he made him a civil bow and said Pray sir was you in need of any professional assistance we could give	17.782794100389232
Who upon his offer thanked him very heartily though preserving his proper distance and replied that he was come there about a lady now an inmate of Horne s house that was in an interesting condition poor body from woman s woe and here he fetched a deep sigh to know if her happiness had yet taken place	7.038135554931555
Mr Dixon to turn the table took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence upon which he rallied him betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due as with the noted physician Mr Austin Meldon to a wolf in the stomach	9.152473108773892
For answer Mr Mulligan in a gale of laughter at his smalls smote himself bravely below the diaphragm exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan the most excellent creature of her sex though tis pity she s a trollop There s a belly that never bore a bastard	9.55855309468529
This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight	83.76776400682921
The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber	316.227766016838
Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student a little fume of a fellow blond as tow congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and interrupting the narrative at a salient point having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it	2.7213387683753076
bien noble stranger said he cheerily mille	1780.428763062773
That you may and very opportunely	949.4860105710369
There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity	5912.555183224002
But gracious heaven was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well my God I would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things	7.038135554931555
With these words he approached the goblet to his lips took a complacent draught of the cordial slicked his hair and opening his bosom out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein	10.481131341546856
Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness Ah Monsieur he said had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily in such an artless disorder of so melting a tenderness pon my conscience even you Monsieur had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever	3.6998304144069647
I declare I was never so touched in all my life	6558.993197170928
God I thank thee as the Author of my days	5233.841450267788
Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours	1333.521432163324
A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and having replaced the locket in his bosom he wiped his eye and sighed again	100.00000000000001
Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond the simple swain and the polished coxcomb the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years	9.55855309468529

My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for as she reminded me blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies dame Nature by the divine blessing has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that y a deux for which the innocence of our original garb in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties is the fittest nay the only garment	3.4034148825183075
But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge	71.09709432312432
Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and while all were conjecturing what might be the cause Miss Callan entered and having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon retired with a profound bow to the company	11.583232862547103
The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry	11.583232862547103

All could see how hard it was for him to be reminded of his promise and of his recent loss	240.40991835099712
He would have withdrawn from the feast had not the noise of voices allayed the smart	873.3261623828432
Madden had lost five drachmas on Sceptre for a whim of the rider s name Lenehan as much more	316.227766016838

Madden up	1.1617274079423625
She was leading the field	410.6204064167453
All hearts were beating	126.99109556487812
Even Phyllis could not contain herself	949.4860105710369
She waved her scarf and cried Huzzah	1780.428763062773
Sceptre wins	1.1617274079423625
But in the straight on the run home when all were in close order the dark horse Throwaway drew level reached outstripped her	121.15276586285881
All was lost now	126.99109556487812
Phyllis was silent her eyes were sad anemones	2703.245875619065

Mercy on the luckless	126.99109556487812
Poor Sceptre	1.1617274079423625
he said with a light sigh	669.5170161800561
She is not the filly that she was	2219.0835711413038
Never by this hand shall we behold such another	4293.13994636419
Do you remember her Vincent	348.2917111358729
I wish you could have seen my queen today Vincent said	7719.846677868277
How young she was and radiant Lalage were scarce fair beside her in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin I do not know the right name of it	46.415888336127786
The chestnuts that shaded us were in bloom the air drooped with their persuasive odour and with pollen floating by us	187.38174228603845
In the sunny patches one might easily have cooked on a stone a batch of those buns with Corinth fruit in them that Periplipomenes sells in his booth near the bridge	36.51741272548377
But she had nought for her teeth but the arm with which I held her and in that she nibbled mischievously when I pressed too close	71.09709432312432
A week ago she lay ill four days on the couch but today she was free blithe mocked at peril	240.40991835099712
She is more taking then	410.6204064167453
Her posies too	21.840993118326033
Mad romp that she is she had pulled her fill as we reclined together	2154.4346900318833
And in your ear my friend you will not think who met us as we left the field	428.1332398719392
Conmee himself	1.1617274079423625
He was walking by the hedge reading I think a brevier book with I doubt not a witty letter in it from Glycera or Chloe to keep the page	46.415888336127786
The sweet creature turned all colours in her confusion feigning to reprove a slight disorder in her dress a slip of underwood clung there for the very trees adore her	41.011270705513006
When Conmee had passed she glanced at her lovely echo in that little mirror she carries	873.3261623828432
But he had been kind	256.5722709452281
In going by he had blessed us	1637.2623817614965
The gods too are ever kind Lenehan said	2903.2601932065677
If I had poor luck with Bass s mare perhaps this draught of his may serve me more propensely	316.227766016838
He was laying his hand upon a winejar Malachi saw it and withheld his act pointing to the stranger and to the scarlet label	100.00000000000001
Warily Malachi whispered preserve a druid silence	1780.428763062773

Do you not think it Stephen	862.742811655988
Theosophos told me so Stephen answered whom in a previous existence Egyptian priests initiated into the mysteries of karmic law	240.40991835099712
The lords of the moon Theosophos told me an orangefiery shipload from planet Alpha of the lunar chain would not assume the etheric doubles and these were therefore incarnated by the rubycoloured egos from the second constellation	20.691380811147894
However as a matter of fact though the preposterous surmise about him being in some description of a doldrums or other or mesmerised which was entirely due to a misconception of the shallowest character was not the case at all	16.57723885589317
The individual whose visual organs while the above was going on were at this juncture commencing to exhibit symptoms of animation was as astute if not astuter than any man living and anybody that conjectured the contrary would have found themselves pretty speedily in the wrong shop	11.006941712522094
During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton on Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone s remark on account of its scarlet appearance	6.218001087320917
He was simply and solely as it subsequently transpired for reasons best known to himself which put quite an altogether different complexion on the proceedings after the moment before s observations about boyhood days and the turf recollecting two or three private transactions of his own which the other two were as mutually innocent of as the babe unborn	6.812920690579612
Eventually however both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with also at the same time however a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place	3.2769055017089728
The debate which ensued was in its scope and progress an epitome of the course of life	599.4842503189408
Neither place nor council was lacking in dignity	2903.2601932065677
The debaters were the keenest in the land the theme they were engaged on the loftiest and most vital	316.227766016838
The high hall of Horne s house had never beheld an assembly so representative and so varied nor had the old rafters of that establishment ever listened to a language so encyclopaedic	32.74549162877729

Crotthers was there at the foot of the table in his striking Highland garb his face glowing from the briny airs of the Mull of Galloway	71.09709432312432
There too opposite to him was Lynch whose countenance bore already the stigmata of early depravity and premature wisdom	316.227766016838
Next the Scotchman was the place assigned to Costello the eccentric while at his side was seated in stolid repose the squat form of Madden	83.76776400682921
The chair of the resident indeed stood vacant before the hearth but on either flank of it the figure of Bannon in explorer s kit of tweed shorts and salted cowhide brogues contrasted sharply with the primrose elegance and townbred manners of Malachi Roland St John Mulligan	11.006941712522094
Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator fresh from the hippodrome and that vigilant wanderer soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come	2.99357729472049
It had better be stated here and now at the outset that the perverted transcendentalism to which Mr S	316.227766016838
Dedalus Div	1.1617274079423625

Science it cannot be too often repeated deals with tangible phenomena	7719.846677868277
The man of science like the man in the street has to face hardheaded facts that cannot be blinked and explain them as best he can	71.09709432312432

Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary the postmenstrual period assert others is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it as most embryologists incline to opine such as Culpepper Spallanzani Blumenbach Lusk Hertwig Leopold and Valenti a mixture of both	6.601948484081891
This would be tantamount to a cooperation one of nature s favourite devices between the of the nemasperm on the one hand and on the other a happily chosen position of the passive element	26.826957952797255
The other problem raised by the same inquirer is scarcely less vital infant mortality	2154.4346900318833

Nature we may rest assured has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development an arrangement which though productive of pain to some of our feelings notably the maternal is nevertheless some of us think in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest	2.9328491084381394

For the enlightenment of those who are not so intimately acquainted with the minutiae of the municipal abattoir as this morbidminded esthete and embryo philosopher who for all his overweening bumptiousness in things scientific can scarcely distinguish an acid from an alkali prides himself on being it should perhaps be stated that staggering bob in the vile parlance of our lowerclass licensed victuallers signifies the cookable and eatable flesh of a calf newly dropped from its mother	4.3754793750741845

Corny Kelleher returns to the outside car and mounts it	5562.856855515288
BLOOM Night	1.1617274079423625
The jarvey chucks the reins and raises his whip encouragingly	5562.856855515288
The car and horse back slowly awkwardly and turn	4293.13994636419
Corny Kelleher on the sideseat sways his head to and fro in sign of mirth at Bloom s plight	316.227766016838
The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat	3727.5937203149383
Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply	2501.287517886216
With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done	100.00000000000001
With a slow nod Bloom conveys his gratitude as that is exactly what Stephen needs	1333.521432163324
The car jingles tooraloom round the corner of the tooraloom lane	5067.7678742710095
Corny Kelleher again reassuralooms with his hand	1618.137084703284

Bloom holding in his hand Stephen s hat festooned with shavings and ashplant stands irresolute	1333.521432163324
Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder BLOOM Eh	3727.5937203149383

Bloom holding the hat and ashplant stands erect	2336.2750273279153
A dog barks in the distance	862.742811655988
Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant	4293.13994636419

He murmurs	1.1617274079423625
in the rough sands of the sea	1538.1684667290513
a cabletow s length from the shore	1780.428763062773
where the tide ebbs	126.99109556487812
and flows	1.1617274079423625
Silent thoughtful alert he stands on guard his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master	428.1332398719392
Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly a fairy boy of eleven a changeling kidnapped dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet holding a book in his hand	24.484367468222267
He reads from right to left inaudibly smiling kissing the page BLOOM Wonderstruck calls inaudibly Rudy	873.3261623828432
RUDY Gazes unseeing into Bloom s eyes and goes on reading kissing smiling	3727.5937203149383
On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons	4293.13994636419
In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot	1333.521432163324
A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket III Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed	12.216773489967919
His Stephen s mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting off the reel the propriety of the cabman s shelter as it was called hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral	3.2769055017089728
But how to get there was the rub	2241.2932826051533
For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned	26.826957952797255
So far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition both of them being e d ed particularly Stephen always assuming that there was such a thing to be found	7.53690398089854
Accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line they both walked together along Beaver street or more properly lane as far as the farrier s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin s	3.874675120456131
But as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree outside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom who was anything but a professional whistler endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle holding his arms arched over his head twice	4.216965034285823
This was a quandary but bringing common sense to bear on it evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did	29.552092352028872
So bevelling around by Mullett s and the Signal House which they shortly reached they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had to vary the timehonoured adage gone the way of all buttons though entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing he heroically made light of the mischance	5.179474679231211
So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time as it happened and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey	12.216773489967919
As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back	22.456979955397745
They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station the starting point for Belfast where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue a not very enticing locality not to say gruesome to a degree more especially at night ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street famous for its C division police station	5.0608719869196825
Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen associated with Baird s the stonecutter s in his mind somehow in Talbot place first turning on the right while the other who was acting as his inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke s city bakery situated quite close to where they were the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable	3.814128748283214
Bread the staff of life earn your bread O tell me where is fancy bread at Rourke s the baker s it is said	100.00000000000001
to his taciturn and not to put too fine a point on it not yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties never more so in fact disgustingly sober spoke a word of caution the dangers of nighttown women of ill fame and swell mobsmen which barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn t look out	2.5306134179675253
Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or failing that the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or he being the solicitor rather old Wall he meant to say or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about	3.6998304144069647
The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen whom he cordially disliked were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and as Mr Bloom put it recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil street prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot	8.11130830789687
Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city Pembroke road for example the guardians of the law were well in evidence the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes	19.14481976169958
Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything	17.782794100389232
You frittered away your time he very sensibly maintained and health and also character besides which the squandermania of the thing fast women of the ran away with a lot of	36.51741272548377
s	1.1617274079423625
d	1.1617274079423625
into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though touching the much vexed question of stimulants he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically	3.75588809068008
Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting but one a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs	26.826957952797255
And that one was Judas Stephen said who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind	428.1332398719392
Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps	14.547578108480476
Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox	12.91549665014884
He began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a friend of his father s Gumley	17.782794100389232
To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge	2154.4346900318833
Someone saluted you Mr Bloom said	507.0296164168668
A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again calling Night	873.3261623828432
Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment	7017.038286703832
Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least	20.691380811147894
Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment s notice your money or your life leaving you there to point a moral gagged and garrotted	3.1992671377973836
Stephen that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice	46.415888336127786
Lord John Corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise	2154.4346900318833
He was the eldest son of inspector Corley of the G division lately deceased who had married a certain Katherine Brophy the daughter of a Louth farmer	61.05402296585327
His grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine also Talbot	100.00000000000001
Rumour had it though not proved that she descended from the house of the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing her mother or aunt or some relative a woman as the tale went of extreme beauty had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen	6.601948484081891
This therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley	46.415888336127786
Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell	3727.5937203149383
Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night s lodgings	7017.038286703832
His friends had all deserted him	949.4860105710369
Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions	71.09709432312432
He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God s earth he could get something anything at all to do	61.05402296585327
No it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn t a complete fabrication from start to finish	9.152473108773892
I wouldn t ask you only pursued he on my solemn oath and God knows I m on the rocks	240.40991835099712
There ll be a job tomorrow or next day Stephen told him in a boys school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher	149.24955450518294
Mr Garrett Deasy	18.60036465451084
You may mention my name	410.6204064167453
Ah God Corley replied sure I couldn t teach in a school man	3727.5937203149383
I was never one of your bright ones he added with a half laugh	2154.4346900318833
I got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers	7300.251061821653
I have no place to sleep myself Stephen informed him	5577.135999216109
Corley at the first go off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street	32.74549162877729
There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street Mrs Maloney s but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon for a bob	8.11130830789687
He was starving too though he hadn t said a word about it	3727.5937203149383
Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence	11.583232862547103
However ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished	8.778013135972484
But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley s head that he was living in affluence and hadn t a thing to do but hand out the needful	26.826957952797255
Whereas	1.1617274079423625
He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for to his chagrin he found his cash missing	6.40400427119728
A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation	7109.842500848915
He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout very much the reverse in fact	22.456979955397745
He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect	873.3261623828432
About biscuits he dimly remembered	410.6204064167453
Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy	2154.4346900318833
However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies erroneously however as it turned out	187.38174228603845
Those are halfcrowns man Corley corrected him	1780.428763062773
And so in point of fact they turned out to be	5226.610628026431
Stephen anyhow lent him one of them	1618.137084703284
Thanks Corley answered you re a gentleman	1573.62613429214
I ll pay you back one time	1780.428763062773
I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan the billsticker	599.4842503189408
You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there	1333.521432163324
I d carry a sandwichboard only the girl in the office told me they re full up for the next three weeks man	121.15276586285881
God you ve to book ahead man you d think it was for the Carl Rosa	873.3261623828432
I don t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job even as a crossing sweeper	316.227766016838
Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam s the shipchandler s bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle s back with O Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe	5.4361836201538365
Anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable	100.00000000000001
Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work it struck him was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while Dublin slept	7.813707376518094
Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity	24.484367468222267
Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round in every deep so to put it a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very altogether	4.948168092155143
In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning	187.38174228603845
Pretty thick that was certainly	410.6204064167453
The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who with his practised eye was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite	46.415888336127786
Alluding to the encounter he said laughingly Stephen that is He is down on his luck	873.3261623828432
He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan a billsticker to give him a job as a sandwichman	187.38174228603845
At this intelligence in which he seemingly evinced little interest Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair whereupon he observed evasively Everybody gets their own ration of luck they say	6.601948484081891
Now you mention it his face was familiar to me	5562.856855515288
But leaving that for the moment how much did you part with he queried if I am not too inquisitive	240.40991835099712
Half a crown Stephen responded	410.6204064167453
I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere	2903.2601932065677
Mr Bloom ejaculated professing not the least surprise at the intelligence I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does	121.15276586285881
Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds	6903.461660503397
But talking about things in general where added he with a smile will you sleep yourself	873.3261623828432
Walking to Sandycove is out of the question	1687.9175793334525
And even supposing you did you won t get in after what occurred at Westland Row station	599.4842503189408
Simply fag out there for nothing	949.4860105710369
I don t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father s house	121.15276586285881
To seek misfortune was Stephen s answer	1643.043796432458
I met your respected father on a recent occasion Mr Bloom diplomatically returned today in fact or to be strictly accurate on yesterday	121.15276586285881
Where does he live at present	862.742811655988
I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved	4824.279665659985
I believe he is in Dublin somewhere Stephen answered unconcernedly	5912.555183224002
Why	1.1617274079423625
A gifted man Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior in more respects than one and a born if ever there was one	121.15276586285881
He takes great pride quite legitimate out of you	4026.008396445538
You could go back perhaps he hasarded still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two Mulligan that is and that English tourist friend of his who eventually euchred their third companion were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion which they did	5.575305334261898
There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however such as it was Stephen s mind s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by the ingle her hair hanging down waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy Boody and Katey the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded it being quarter tense or if not ember days or something like that	2.176896784350984
No Mr Bloom repeated again I wouldn t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element Dr Mulligan as a guide philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes	20.691380811147894
He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals	100.00000000000001
Of course you didn t notice as much as I did	5496.103155809317
But it wouldn t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object	52.983169062837085
He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man by no means confined to medicine only who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and if the report was verified bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries or Malahide was it was he was bound to admit an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy pure and simple	2.224447817359432
Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains he ventured to throw out	187.38174228603845
The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at Stephen s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less	3.874675120456131
Adjacent to the men s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way there being some little differences between the parties	12.216773489967919

Cinque la testa più Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman s shelter an unpretentious wooden structure where prior to then he had rarely if ever been before the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin the Goat Fitzharris the invincible though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in	4.460162165376301
A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity	7.53690398089854
Now touching a cup of coffee Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food say a roll of some description	20.691380811147894
Accordingly his first act was with characteristic to order these commodities quietly	7017.038286703832
Mr Bloom availing himself of the right of free speech he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute though to be sure rather in a quandary over remarked to his in an audible tone of voice of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious A beautiful language	7.53690398089854
I mean for singing purposes	367.1967010491309
Why do you not write your poetry in that language	4924.2856751531135
	1.1617274079423625
It is so melodious and full	949.4860105710369

Voglio Stephen who was trying his dead best to yawn if he could suffering from lassitude generally replied To fill the ear of a cow elephant	71.09709432312432
They were haggling over money	410.6204064167453
Is that so	18.469695921350887
Mr Bloom asked	14.730183987478947
Of course he subjoined pensively at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it	36.51741272548377
After which he beat a retreat to his counter Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to	52.983169062837085
For which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him	29.552092352028872
Sounds are impostures Stephen said after a pause of some little time like names	2154.4346900318833
Cicero Podmore Napoleon Mr Goodbody	410.6204064167453
Jesus Mr Doyle	21.840993118326033
Shakespeares were as common as Murphies	949.4860105710369
What s in a name	269.93033741218426
Yes to be sure Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred	2506.0203003523443
Of course	1.1617274079423625
Our name was changed too he added pushing the socalled roll across	7017.038286703832
The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded Stephen whom he had singled out for attention in particular squarely by asking And what might your name be	36.51741272548377
Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion s boot but Stephen apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter answered Dedalus	71.09709432312432
The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes rather bunged up from excessive use of boose preferably good old Hollands and water	61.05402296585327
You know Simon Dedalus	126.99109556487812
he asked at length	126.99109556487812
I ve heard of him Stephen said	1505.608178403045
Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too	1333.521432163324
He s Irish the seaman bold affirmed staring still in much the same way and nodding	873.3261623828432
All Irish	1.1617274079423625
All too Irish Stephen rejoined	410.6204064167453
As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder	7.2789538439831505
The lefthand dead shot	126.99109556487812
Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain	83.76776400682921
Bottles out there say	126.99109556487812
Fifty yards measured	21.840993118326033
Eggs on the bottles	126.99109556487812
Cocks his gun over his shoulder	758.1193697407432
Aims	1.1617274079423625
He turned his body half round shut up his right eye completely	7017.038286703832
Then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance	240.40991835099712
Pom	1.1617274079423625
he then shouted once	126.99109556487812
The entire audience waited anticipating an additional detonation there being still a further egg	2154.4346900318833
Pom	1.1617274079423625
he shouted twice	21.840993118326033
Egg two evidently demolished he nodded and winked adding bloodthirstily Buffalo Bill shoots to kill Never missed nor he never will A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley	12.216773489967919
Long ago	1.1617274079423625
Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth	1780.428763062773
Why the sailor replied relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond it might be a matter of ten years	83.76776400682921
He toured the wide world with Hengler s Royal Circus	5247.276053407287
I seen him do that in Stockholm	1643.043796432458
Curious coincidence Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively	2321.680448289125

Across the world for a wife	641.1760162089153

The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand	26.826957952797255
Thank you the sailor said	361.48876812228025
He deposited the quid in his gob and chewing and with some slow stammers proceeded We come up this morning eleven o clock	121.15276586285881

In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document	149.24955450518294
You must have seen a fair share of the world the keeper remarked leaning on the counter	599.4842503189408
Why the sailor answered upon reflection upon it I ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on	428.1332398719392
I was in the Red Sea	386.89694228736295
We was chased by pirates one voyage	1780.428763062773

You seen queer sights don t be talking put in a jarvey	7017.038286703832
Why the sailor said shifting his partially chewed plug	3684.3440696467324
I seen queer things too ups and downs	2903.2601932065677
I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid	873.3261623828432
He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and lodging it between his teeth bit ferociously Khaan	428.1332398719392

Here they are	21.840993118326033
A friend of mine sent me	773.4676608087022
He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table	61.05402296585327
The printed matter on it stated de Indios	2903.2601932065677

Mr Bloom without evincing surprise unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark	428.1332398719392

Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in on which occasion the former s ball passed through the latter s hat having detected a discrepancy between his name assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q t	4.460162165376301
somewhere and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend s nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest	3.6458412370707323

The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable especially for a chap whose liver was out of order seeing the different places along the route Plymouth Falmouth Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement tower abbey wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with	4.3754793750741845
Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas Eastbourne Scarborough Margate and so on beautiful Bournemouth the Channel islands and similar bijou spots which might prove highly remunerative	4.948168092155143

No something top notch an all star Irish caste the Tweedy Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody Manners perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure	4.641588833612779
But who	1.1617274079423625
That was the rub	85.21198574747604
Also without being actually positive it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times of the Fishguard Rosslare route which it was mooted was once more on the in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally	6.042963902381328

It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street when the system really needed toning up for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick in the mud took me for a wife	4.460162165376301

Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy so to speak and the accommodation left much to be desired	100.00000000000001
Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity pure and simple was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact	29.552092352028872
He turned back the other side of the card picture and passed it along to Stephen	873.3261623828432

Mr Bloom so far as he was personally concerned was just pondering in pensive mood	1333.521432163324

Mr Bloom inquired	21.840993118326033
The sailor grimaced chewing in a way that might be read as yes ay or no	873.3261623828432
Ah you ve touched there too Mr Bloom said Europa point thinking he had in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn	9.152473108773892
What year would that be about	949.4860105710369

His questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe suffice it to say that as a casual glance at the map revealed it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves	5.4361836201538365
On more than one occasion a dozen at the lowest near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt evidently derelict seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall staring quite obliviously at it and it at him dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings	7.53690398089854
And it left him wondering why	949.4860105710369
Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under well not exactly under tempting the fates	26.826957952797255
And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all	873.3261623828432
There was a fellow sailed with me in the the old seadog himself a rover proceeded went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman s valet at six quid a month	29.552092352028872
Them are his trousers I ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife	599.4842503189408
I m game for that job shaving and brushup	4293.13994636419
I hate roaming about	126.99109556487812
There s my son now Danny run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money	46.415888336127786
What age is he	126.99109556487812
queried one hearer who by the way seen from the side bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell the townclerk away from the carking cares of office unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage	12.216773489967919
Why the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance my son Danny	7017.038286703832
He d be about eighteen now way I figure it	5912.555183224002
The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an anchor	16.57723885589317
I must get a wash tomorrow or next day	3283.0298175454755
It s them black lads I objects to	2694.78913506113
I hate those buggers	108.9829112695572
Suck your blood dry they does	949.4860105710369
Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure and a young man s sideface looking frowningly rather	11.006941712522094
Tattoo the exhibitor explained	126.99109556487812
That was done when we were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton	599.4842503189408
Fellow the name of Antonio done that	1323.256575275821
There he is himself a Greek	646.7227729202078
Did it hurt much doing it	949.4860105710369
one asked the sailor	111.05117566129712
That worthy however was busily engaged in collecting round the	5562.856855515288
Someway in his	21.840993118326033
Squeezing or	1.1617274079423625
See here he said showing Antonio	862.742811655988
There he is cursing the mate	711.7465568061971
And there he is now he added the same fellow pulling the skin with his fingers some special knack evidently and he laughing at a yarn	71.09709432312432
And in point of fact the young man named Antonio s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin the Goat who this time stretched over	19.14481976169958
Ay ay sighed the sailor looking down on his manly chest	6357.966312665358
He s gone too	100.49400469796984
Ate by sharks after	126.99109556487812
He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before	873.3261623828432
Neat bit of work one longshoreman said	1780.428763062773
And what s the number for	773.4676608087022
Eaten alive	1.1617274079423625
a third asked the sailor	367.1967010491309
Ay ay sighed again the latter personage more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number	32.74549162877729
Ate	1.1617274079423625
A Greek he was	126.99109556487812
And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged end As bad as old Antonio For he left me on my ownio	100.00000000000001
The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill	22.456979955397745
Mr Bloom scarcely knowing which way to look turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm and picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey if such he was had laid aside he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink	7.53690398089854
His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond quay the partially idiotic female namely of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you Mrs B and begged the chance of his washing	7.038135554931555
Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not your washing	7719.846677868277
Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a man s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper s marking ink hers were that is if they really loved him that is to say love me love my dirty shirt	7.53690398089854
Still just then being on tenterhooks he desired the female s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off	24.484367468222267
Round the side of the he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper Murphy s nautical chest and then there was no more of her	7.2789538439831505
The gunboat the keeper said	367.1967010491309
Unfortunate creature	1.1617274079423625
Of course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition	7017.038286703832
Still no matter what the cause is from	2703.245875619065
Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders merely remarking In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade	61.05402296585327
Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul	1333.521432163324
She is a bad merchant	367.1967010491309
She buys dear and sells cheap	949.4860105710369
The elder man though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to to say that women of that stamp quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject a necessary evil were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities a thing he could truthfully state he as a was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start	4.071515547789689
You as a good catholic he observed talking of body and soul believe in the soul	873.3261623828432
Or do you mean the intelligence the brainpower as such as distinct from any outside object the table let us say that cup	121.15276586285881
I believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter	240.40991835099712
Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays for instance	7017.038286703832
Do you	1.1617274079423625
It would be immortal I understand but for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who from all I can hear is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes per and per both being excluded by court etiquette	11.583232862547103
Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple promptly rejoining Simple	17.782794100389232
I shouldn t think that is the proper word	3571.3583767964046
Of course I grant you to concede a point you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon	187.38174228603845
But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man I mean and the same applies to the laws for example of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God	4.3754793750741845
O that Stephen expostulated has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ apart from circumstantial evidence	187.38174228603845
On this knotty point however the views of the pair poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages clashed	41.011270705513006
Has been	1.1617274079423625
I m not so sure about that	1232.9839652527453
That s a matter for everyman s opinion and without dragging in the sectarian side of the business I beg to differ with you there	83.76776400682921
My belief is to tell you the candid truth that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it s the big question of our national poet over again who precisely wrote them like and Bacon as you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I of course I needn t tell you	6.601948484081891
Can t you drink that coffee by the way	3314.9646975165833
Let me stir it	126.99109556487812
And take a piece of that bun	1618.137084703284
It s like one of our skipper s bricks disguised	5233.841450267788
Still no one can give what he hasn t got	5562.856855515288
Try a bit	21.840993118326033
Couldn t Stephen contrived to get out his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further	599.4842503189408
Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance and lucrative work	20.691380811147894
To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night concerts dramatic evenings and useful lectures admittance free by qualified men for the lower orders	9.55855309468529
On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying	22.456979955397745
The idea he was strongly inclined to believe was to do good and net a profit there being no competition to speak of	121.15276586285881
Anyhow inspection medical inspection of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble s Vi Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved	29.552092352028872
Have a shot at it now he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred	873.3261623828432
Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage	22.456979955397745
Still it s solid food his good genius urged I m a stickler for solid food his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the qua for any kind of proper work mental or manual	14.547578108480476
You ought to eat more solid food	1419.4772683741962
You would feel a different man	787.0887026711796
Liquids I can eat Stephen said	949.4860105710369
But O oblige me by taking away that knife	4293.13994636419
I can t look at the point of it	2667.4780710325467
It reminds me of Roman history	866.2253711860347
Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it	17.782794100389232
Our mutual friend s stories are like himself Mr Bloom of knives remarked to his sotto	873.3261623828432
Do you think they are genuine	803.3290774201911
He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots	599.4842503189408
Look at him	18.469695921350887
Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel	5.722367659350217
He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him	100.00000000000001
Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina if a trifle prone to baldness there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity	10.0
He might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told as people often did about others namely that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described	4.548777947003777
On the other hand he might be only bluffing a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs Dublin residents like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner and etcetera	12.216773489967919
And when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him	41.011270705513006
Mind you I m not saying that it s all a pure invention he resumed	1333.521432163324
Analogous scenes are occasionally if not often met with	4293.13994636419
Giants though that is rather a far cry you see once in a way Marcella the midget queen	428.1332398719392
In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs as they are called sitting bowlegged they couldn t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here you see he proceeded indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up being adored as gods	4.948168092155143
There s an example again of simple souls	2903.2601932065677
However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures who reminded him a bit of Ludwig Ledwidge when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the a stupendous success and his host of admirers came in large numbers everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort phantom or the reverse on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it he conceded	3.9376589235643866
On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic off him or her next day on the quiet and he added on the cheap	3.0253054571024545
Spaniards for instance he continued passionate temperaments like that impetuous as Old Nick are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen	20.691380811147894
It comes from the great heat climate generally	2903.2601932065677
My wife is so to speak Spanish half that is	5123.53892068312
Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted having been born in technically Spain i e	240.40991835099712
Gibraltar	1.1617274079423625
Quite dark regular brunette black	410.6204064167453
I for one certainly believe climate accounts for character	4293.13994636419
That s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian	3727.5937203149383
The temperaments at the door Stephen interposed with were very passionate about ten shillings	2154.4346900318833
ruba roba	1.1617274079423625
Quite so Mr Bloom dittoed	367.1967010491309
Then Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino	20.691380811147894
It s in the blood Mr Bloom acceded at once	4256.227384583083
All are washed in the blood of the sun	2177.149940577808
Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museum today shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it and I was just looking at those antique statues there	29.552092352028872
The splendid proportions of hips bosom	949.4860105710369
You simply don t knock against those kind of women here	7719.846677868277
An exception here and there	310.29263898985454
Handsome yes pretty in a way you find but what I m talking about is the female form	428.1332398719392
Besides they have so little taste in dress most of them which greatly enhances a woman s natural beauty no matter what you say	100.00000000000001
Rumpled stockings it may be possibly is a foible of mine but still it s a thing I simply hate to see	149.24955450518294
Interest however was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea ships lost in a fog collisions with icebergs all that sort of thing	26.826957952797255
Shipahoy of course had his own say to say	4293.13994636419
He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon a kind of wind in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing he declared stood to him or words to that effect a pious medal he had that saved him	9.152473108773892
So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt s rock wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it on Booterstown strand	11.583232862547103
That was the talk of the town that year Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror	12.91549665014884
Then someone said something about the case of the s	4226.474962651787
s	1.1617274079423625
of Swansea run into by the which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck	121.15276586285881
No aid was given	126.99109556487812
Her master the s said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way	2154.4346900318833
She had no water it appears in her hold	4026.008396445538
At this stage an incident happened	949.4860105710369
It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat	1333.521432163324
Let me cross your bows mate he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze	187.38174228603845
He made tracks heavily slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left	36.51741272548377
While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and applying its nozzle to his lips take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise	4.840960141478948
The irrepressible Bloom who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes could by straining just perceive him when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved	4.071515547789689
Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor evidently giving it a wide berth eased himself closer at hand the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank	5.0608719869196825
A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled	7017.038286703832
Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who though now broken down and fast breaking up was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid now practically on the parish rates given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of	2.4081270125596355
He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if a big if however he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality	15.505157798326243
All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping coastwise and foreign as well which was all part and parcel of the same thing	71.09709432312432
A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin the only launch that year	599.4842503189408
Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called	7719.846677868277
There were wrecks and wreckers the keeper said who was evidently	6903.461660503397
What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington or some name like that eh	24.484367468222267
Ask the then captain he advised them how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day s work Captain John Lever of the Lever Line	61.05402296585327
Am I right skipper	111.05117566129712
he queried of the sailor now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions	599.4842503189408
That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds	32.74549162877729
Mr Bloom s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably which it was so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question	9.55855309468529
Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation potation introducing an atmosphere of drink into the boisterously trolling like a veritable son of a seacook The biscuits was as hard as brass And the beef as salt as Lot s wife s arse	13.68874509537081
O Johnny Lever	21.840993118326033
Johnny Lever O	21.840993118326033
After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided	83.76776400682921
Skin the Goat assuming he was he evidently with an axe to grind was airing his grievances in a forcible feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God s earth far and away superior to England with coal in large quantities six million pounds worth of pork exported every year ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein	2.589543080585877
Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact	3727.5937203149383
Where would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon	5241.94263730665
But a day of reckoning he stated with no uncertain voice thoroughly monopolising all the conversation was in store for mighty England despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes	32.74549162877729
There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history	6465.157402662053
The Germans and the Japs were going to have their little lookin he affirmed	2154.4346900318833
The Boers were the beginning of the end	2501.287517886216
Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland her Achilles heel which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles the Greek hero a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot	9.55855309468529
His advice to every Irishman was stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland	187.38174228603845
Ireland Parnell said could not spare a single one of her sons	7017.038286703832
Silence all round marked the termination of his	2694.78913506113
The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings undismayed	2903.2601932065677
Take a bit of doing boss retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism	240.40991835099712
To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view	240.40991835099712
Who s the best troops in the army	2165.8232047978977
the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated	949.4860105710369
And the best jumpers and racers	862.742811655988
And the best admirals and generals we ve got	4014.671278934556
Tell me that	21.840993118326033
The Irish for choice retorted the cabby like Campbell facial blemishes apart	7017.038286703832
That s right the old tarpaulin corroborated	1452.1988812430416
The Irish catholic peasant	126.99109556487812
He s the backbone of our empire	1618.1370847032842
You know Jem Mullins	126.99109556487812
While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire ours or his and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it	36.51741272548377
Then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter both needless to say appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn t indulge in recriminations and come to blows	14.547578108480476
From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for rather concealed their strength than the opposite	5.722367659350217
It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if as time went on that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies equally relevant to the issue might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart	3.5938136638046276
Another little interesting point the amours of whores and chummies to put it in common parlance reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her more so in fact	29.552092352028872
And now why	21.840993118326033
So the scene between the pair of them the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris the famous invincible and the other obviously bogus reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick supposing that is it was prearranged as the lookeron a student of the human soul if anything the others seeing least of the game	5.878016072274914
And as for the lessee or keeper who probably wasn t the other person at all he B couldn t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen s evidence or king s now like Denis or Peter Carey an idea he utterly repudiated	3.5436477855785484
Quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle	2154.4346900318833
Yet though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form he certainly did feel and no denying it while inwardly remaining what he was a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife cold steel with the courage of his political convictions though personally he would never be a party to any such thing off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south have her or swing for her when the husband frequently after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal he having had the pair watched inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial by plunging his knife into her until it just struck him that Fitz nicknamed Skin the Goat merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not if he was reliably informed actually party to the ambush which in point of fact was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on	1.8890484375835332
In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend the pseudo Skin the etcetera he had transparently outlived his welcome	71.09709432312432
He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high	6845.590176294844
Like actresses always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again	7017.038286703832
Generous to a fault of course temperamental no economising or any idea of the sort always snapping at the bone for the shadow	121.15276586285881
So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some	873.3261623828432
s	1.1617274079423625
d	1.1617274079423625
in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the tavern come back to Erin and so on	121.15276586285881
Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender	52.983169062837085
He took umbrage at something or other that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared I let slip	316.227766016838
He called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively	6739.220595326561
So I without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his God I mean Christ was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality I m not	29.552092352028872
That was one for him	367.1967010491309
A soft answer turns away wrath	949.4860105710369
He hadn t a word to say for himself as everyone saw	7017.038286703832
Am I not right	111.05117566129712
He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn t all exactly	15.505157798326243
Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent their two or four eyes conversing or Bloom his name is or after all any other	149.24955450518294
Of course Mr B	126.99109556487812
proceeded to stipulate you must look at both sides of the question	7017.038286703832
It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country they say our own distressful included has the government it deserves	17.782794100389232
But with a little goodwill all round	1618.137084703284
It s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality	1333.521432163324
I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form	4924.2856751531135
It never reaches anything or stops anything	1780.428763062773
A revolution must come on the due instalments plan	4293.13994636419
It s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular in the next house so to speak	41.011270705513006
Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes war Stephen assented between Skinner s alley and Ormond market	599.4842503189408
And the whole world was full of that sort of thing	5018.196989338378
You just took the words out of my mouth he said	6537.500951083793
A hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn t remotely	6913.256074537164
All those wretched quarrels in his humble opinion stirring up bad blood from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything greed and jealousy people never knowing when to stop	6.812920690579612
They accuse remarked he audibly	410.6204064167453
He turned away from the others who probably and spoke nearer to so as the others in case they Jews he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen s ear are accused of ruining	26.826957952797255
Not a vestige of truth in it I can safely say	5935.666304661946
History would you be surprised to learn proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for imported them	15.505157798326243
Why	1.1617274079423625
Because they are imbued with the proper spirit	2903.2601932065677
They are practical and are proved to be so	3977.110094220475
I don t want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are	121.15276586285881
Spain again you saw in the war compared with goahead America	7719.846677868277
Turks	1.1617274079423625
It s in the dogma	273.165439595843
Because if they didn t believe they d go straight to heaven when they die they d try to live better at least so I think	71.09709432312432
That s the juggle on which the p p s raise the wind on false pretences	873.3261623828432
I m he resumed with dramatic force as good an Irishman as that rude person I told you about at the outset and I want to see everyone concluded he all creeds and classes having a comfortable tidysized income in no niggard fashion either something in the neighbourhood of per annum	9.152473108773892
That s the vital issue at stake and it s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man	149.24955450518294
At least that s my idea for what it s worth	6903.461660503397
I call that patriotism	126.99109556487812
as we learned a smattering of in our classical days in Mater vita	3727.5937203149383
Where you can live well the sense is if you work	6903.461660503397
Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee listening to this synopsis of things in general Stephen stared at nothing in particular	121.15276586285881
He could hear of course all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to	15.505157798326243
Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn t say the words the voice he heard said if you work	100.00000000000001
Count me out he managed to remark meaning work	4293.13994636419
The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he the person who owned them pro tem	599.4842503189408
observed or rather his voice speaking did all must work have to together	3727.5937203149383
I mean of course the other hastened to affirm work in the widest possible sense	1333.521432163324
Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing	5781.457601528645
Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays	5515.522139545052
That s work too	126.99109556487812
Important work	1.1617274079423625
After all from the little I know of you after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price	61.05402296585327
You have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has	187.38174228603845
What	1.1617274079423625
You both belong to Ireland the brain and the brawn	5912.555183224002
Each is equally important	126.99109556487812
You suspect Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh that I may be important because I belong to the Saint called Ireland for short	71.09709432312432
I would go a step farther Mr Bloom insinuated	4014.671278934556
But I suspect Stephen interrupted that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me	1333.521432163324
What belongs queried Mr Bloom bending fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension	3727.5937203149383
Excuse me	1.1617274079423625
Unfortunately I didn t catch the latter portion	2302.541997954906
What was it you	97.6612821940667
Stephen patently crosstempered repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely adding We can t change the country	52.983169062837085
At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom to change the subject looked down but in a quandary as he couldn t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry	24.484367468222267
The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part	6558.993197170928
Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state	100.00000000000001
Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn t been familiarised with the right sort of people	41.011270705513006
With a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister failing to throw much light on the subject however he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves	4.641588833612779
For instance there was the case of O Callaghan for one the halfcrazy faddist respectably connected though of inadequate means with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper a fact	7.2789538439831505
And then the usual after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains	3.9376589235643866
Briefly putting two and two together six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to Antonio and so forth jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne then heir apparent the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature a thing good Mrs Grundy as the law stands was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it	2.02650867063685
Ladies who like distinctive underclothing should and every welltailored man must trying to make the gap wider between them by innuendo and give more of a genuine filip to acts of impropriety between the two she unbuttoned his and then he untied her mind the pin whereas savages in the cannibal islands say at ninety degrees in the shade not caring a continental	6.042963902381328

Still to cultivate the acquaintance of someone of no uncommon calibre who could provide food for reflection would amply repay any small	149.24955450518294

Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands	3.6458412370707323
Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the where art order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility	7.2789538439831505
Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet whereas Messrs So and So who though they weren t even a patch on the former man ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between	5.4361836201538365

He saw him once on the auspicious occasion when they broke up the type in the or was it a privilege he keenly appreciated and in point of fact handed him his silk hat when it was knocked off and he said excited as he undoubtedly was under his frigid exterior notwithstanding the little misadventure mentioned between the cup and the lip what s bred in the bone	5.30441727984393
Still as regards return	126.99109556487812
You were a lucky dog if they didn t set the terrier at you directly you got back	428.1332398719392
Then a lot of shillyshally usually followed Tom for and Dick and Harry against	2154.4346900318833
A more prudent course as Bloom said to the not over effusive in fact like the distinguished personage under discussion beside him would have been to sound the lie of the land first	29.552092352028872

This gratuitous contribution of a humorous character occasioned a fair amount of laughter among his	1333.521432163324
As regards Bloom he without the faintest suspicion of a smile merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts to make matters worse were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings	7.53690398089854
First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed however who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into	4.460162165376301
Since their names were coupled though since he was her declared favourite where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops the fact namely that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel having gained admittance in the same fashion a fact the weeklies addicted to the lubric a little simply coined shoals of money out of	2.6751640979693976
Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch with nothing in common between them beyond the name and then a real man arriving on the scene strong to the verge of weakness falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties the usual sequel to bask in the loved one s smiles	5.30441727984393
The eternal question of the life connubial needless to say cropped up	7017.038286703832

A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order as compared with the other military supernumerary that is who was just the usual everyday my gallant kind of an individual in the light dragoons the th hussars to be accurate and inflammable doubtless the fallen leader that is not the other in his own peculiar way which she of course woman quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole his erstwhile staunch adherents and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass s kick	2.02650867063685
Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream	1333.521432163324
And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times	46.415888336127786
Why as he reflected Irishtown strand a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since as it happened he went to reside on the north side	26.826957952797255
North or south however it was just the wellknown case of hot passion pure and simple upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so types that wouldn t do things by halves passionate abandon of the south casting every shred of decency to the winds	6.40400427119728
Just bears out what I was saying he with glowing bosom said to Stephen about blood and the sun	316.227766016838
And if I don t greatly mistake she was Spanish too	5608.95830999585
The king of Spain s daughter Stephen answered adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many	17.782794100389232
Was she	1.1617274079423625
Bloom ejaculated surprised though not astonished by any means I never heard that rumour before	1333.521432163324
Possible especially there it was as she lived there	4014.671278934556
So Spain	1.1617274079423625
Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket which reminded him by the by of that Capel street library book out of date he took out his pocketbook and turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he	19.14481976169958
Do you consider by the by he said thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table that a Spanish type	121.15276586285881
Stephen obviously addressed looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom with more than vision of breasts her full lips parted and some perfect teeth standing near ostensibly with gravity a piano on the rest of which was Old a ballad pretty in its way which was then all the vogue	3.6458412370707323
Her the lady s eyes dark large looked at Stephen about to smile about something to be admired Lafayette of Westmoreland street Dublin s premier photographic artist being responsible for the esthetic execution	29.552092352028872
Mrs Bloom my wife the Madam Marion Tweedy Bloom indicated	5577.135999216109
Taken a few years since	367.1967010491309
In or about ninety six	410.6204064167453
Very like her then	126.99109556487812
Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who he intimated was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen	8.11130830789687
As for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup	14.547578108480476
He dwelt being a bit of an artist in his spare time on the female form in general developmentally because as it so happened no later than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues perfectly developed as works of art in the National Museum	12.216773489967919
Marble could give the original shoulders back all the symmetry all the rest	3727.5937203149383
Yes puritanisme it does though Saint Joseph s sovereign thievery alors Bandez Figne toi trop	1333.521432163324
Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn t art in a word	3727.5937203149383
The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself her stage presence being frankly a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to	5.878016072274914
But it was scarcely professional etiquette so	1618.1370847032842
Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering for sunshine after storm	149.24955450518294
And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion	46.415888336127786
Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves none the worse for wear however and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving	14.547578108480476
In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled good as new much better in fact with the starch out	52.983169062837085
I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray	7.038135554931555
The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished educated and impulsive into the bargain far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn t think he had it in him yet you would	22.456979955397745
Besides he said the picture was handsome which say what you like it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter	149.24955450518294
And why not	21.840993118326033
An awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business	10.0
How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations when the thing ran its normal course became in due course intimate	4.948168092155143
Then the decree and the King s proctor tries to show cause why and he failing to quash it was made absolute	149.24955450518294
But as for that the two misdemeanants wrapped up as they largely were in one another could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course	10.0
He B enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic when the fallen leader s who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery leader s trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the or no it was a by no means by the by appropriate appellative and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune s private morals	2.51188643150958
Though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she however was the first to perceive	6.812920690579612
As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach fortunately not of a grave character	11.583232862547103
His hat Parnell s a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and as a matter of strict history Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he as a matter of fact having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else what s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect saying you though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day history repeating itself with a difference after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave	1.7487126295116875
On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest laughing immoderately pretending to understand everything the why and the wherefore and in reality not knowing their own minds it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another s arms drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others	1.8957356524063758
He personally being of a sceptical bias believed and didn t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument when neglecting her duties she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent the upshot being that her affections centred on another the cause of many between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt	2.392147081462638
It was a thousand pities a young fellow blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime	16.57723885589317
In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies society was a sine qua though he had the gravest possible doubts not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers ways and flowers and chocs	2.5694257109482446
To think of him house and homeless rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother was really too bad at his age	149.24955450518294
The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or failing that the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled	9.152473108773892
At what o clock did you dine	1780.428763062773
he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face	7719.846677868277
Some time yesterday Stephen said	367.1967010491309
Yesterday	1.1617274079423625
exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow Friday	5562.856855515288
Ah you mean it s after twelve	1780.428763062773
The day before yesterday Stephen said improving on himself	3764.8668526744877
Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected	4014.671278934556
Though they didn t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling so to speak in the one train of thought	32.74549162877729
At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a aspirant to parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas	9.152473108773892
For instance when the evicted tenants question then at its first inception bulked largely in people s mind though it goes without saying not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums some of which wouldn t exactly hold water he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion a partiality however which realising his mistake he was subsequently partially cured of and even was twitted with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan s so that he though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals be it repeated departed from his customary habit to give him metaphorically one in the gizzard though so far as politics themselves were concerned he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows chiefly destruction of the fittest in a word	1.725706061858534
Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons getting on for one as it was it was high time to be retiring for the night	83.76776400682921
The crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue somebody having a temper of her own sometimes and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog breed unknown with a lame paw not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he had hurt his hand too to Ontario Terrace as he very distinctly remembered having been there so to speak	4.3754793750741845
On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives	32.74549162877729
Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity all things considered	187.38174228603845
His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway	316.227766016838
For one thing he mightn t what you call jump at the idea if approached and what mostly worried him was he didn t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly supposing he did entertain the proposal as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe if found suitable	5.179474679231211
At all events he wound up by concluding eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent a cup of Epps s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up	4.071515547789689
A move had to be made because that merry old soul the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot didn t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character s whereabouts for a few days to come alternately racking their feelings the mermaids with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address as Mr Algebra remarks	2.188447106460033
At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew	121.15276586285881
People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep	187.38174228603845
The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles	2903.2601932065677
Your god was a jew	305.4025733674428
Because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick on Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo	428.1332398719392
I propose our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo as it s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over	41.011270705513006
My diggings are quite close in the vicinity	2414.681536312937
You can t drink that stuff	866.2253711860347
Do you like cocoa	126.99109556487812
Wait	1.1617274079423625
I ll just pay this lot	851.2348218321658
Yes that s the best he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less	61.05402296585327
All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his B s busy brain education the genuine article literature journalism prize titbits up to date billing concert tours in English watering resorts packed with hydros and seaside theatres turning money away duets in Italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things no necessity of course to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it and a slice of luck	4.3754793750741845
An opening was all was wanted	949.4860105710369
Because he more than suspected he had his father s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well by the way no harm to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to	9.152473108773892
The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy earl Cadogan had presided at the cabdrivers association dinner in London somewhere	52.983169062837085
Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement	5912.555183224002
Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary s lodge or words to that effect	22.456979955397745
To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why	4014.671278934556
Give us a squint at that literature grandfather the ancient mariner put in manifesting some natural impatience	599.4842503189408
And welcome answered the elderly party thus addressed	2903.2601932065677
The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears	83.76776400682921
Are you bad in the eyes	866.2253711860347
the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried	1780.428763062773
Why answered the seafarer with the tartan beard who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as I uses goggles reading	19.14481976169958

To cut a long story short Bloom grasping the situation was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming making a grand total of fourpence the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers literally the last of the Mohicans he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures coffee d confectionery do and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way as Wetherup used to remark	2.317199913684755
Come he counselled to close the	949.4860105710369
Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their far	22.456979955397745
Stephen who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out paused at the for a moment the door	428.1332398719392
One thing I never understood he said to be original on the spur of the moment	873.3261623828432
To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment s hesitation saying straight off To sweep the floor in the morning	149.24955450518294
So saying he skipped around nimbly considering frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion s right a habit of his by the bye his right side being in classical idiom his tender Achilles	20.691380811147894
The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins	316.227766016838
It will the air do you good Bloom said meaning also the walk in a moment	873.3261623828432
The only thing is to walk then you ll feel a different man	3727.5937203149383
Come	1.1617274079423625
It s not far	108.9829112695572
Lean on me	21.840993118326033
Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen s right and led him on accordingly	1333.521432163324
Yes Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him sinewless and wobbly and all that	71.09709432312432
Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones brazier etc	4293.13994636419
And of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings	7.53690398089854
So they turned on to chatting about music a form of art for which Bloom as a pure amateur possessed the greatest love as they made tracks arm in arm across Beresford place	29.552092352028872
Wagnerian music though confessedly grand in its way was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go off but the music of Mercadante s Meyerbeer s Last Words on the and Mozart s he simply revelled in the in that being to his mind the acme of first class music as such literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat	5.575305334261898
He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or me to live and I will live thy protestant to	19.14481976169958
He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini s a work simply abounding in immortal numbers in which his wife Madam Marion Tweedy made a hit a veritable sensation he might safely say greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade in the jesuit fathers church in upper Gardiner street the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos or rather	4.738879609717654
There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore	17.782794100389232
On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the description and a gem in its line he had a though with only a surface knowledge for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn	26.826957952797255
And talking of that taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites he mentioned Lionel s air in M which curiously enough he had heard or overheard to be more accurate on yesterday a privilege he keenly appreciated from the lips of Stephen s respected father sung to perfection a study of the number in fact which made all the others take a back seat	5.30441727984393
Stephen in reply to a politely put query said he didn t sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare s songs at least of in or about that period the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist who ludendo hausi an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch whom B	7.038135554931555
did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their and conceits and Byrd William who played the virginals he said in the Queen s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull	8.778013135972484
On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse dragging a sweeper paced on the paven ground brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull	8.431909292866257
He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk as it struck him the two identical names as a striking coincidence	83.76776400682921
By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn which perceiving Bloom who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual plucked the other s sleeve gently jocosely remarking Our lives are in peril tonight	26.826957952797255
Beware of the steamroller	111.05117566129712
They thereupon stopped	21.840993118326033
Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker a hipshaker a blackbuttocker a taildangler a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch busy with his thoughts	5.179474679231211
But such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn t a lump of sugar but as he wisely reflected you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up	29.552092352028872
He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse without a second care in the world	316.227766016838
But even a dog he reflected take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan s of the same size would be a holy horror to face	100.00000000000001
But it was no animal s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel ship of the desert distilling grapes into potheen in his hump	46.415888336127786
Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees	316.227766016838
Whale with a harpoon hairpin alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke chalk a circle for a rooster tiger my eagle eye	61.05402296585327
These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old	24.484367468222267
What s this I was saying	790.2658757816902
Ah yes	1.1617274079423625
My wife he intimated plunging medias would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind	71.09709432312432
He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen image of his mother which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built	13.68874509537081
Still supposing he had his father s gift as he more than suspected it opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall s Irish industries concert on the preceding Monday and aristocracy in general	20.691380811147894
Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air here has by Jans Pieter Sweelinck a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from	100.00000000000001
Even more he liked an old German song of about the clear sea and the voices of sirens sweet murderers of men which boggled Bloom a bit Von der Sirenen Listigkeit Tun die Poeten dichten	24.484367468222267
These opening bars he sang and translated	1780.428763062773
Bloom nodding said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did	428.1332398719392
A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that the rarest of boons which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out could easily if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B	3.359818286283782
A	1.1617274079423625
a huge ad in its way and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he a youthful tyro in society s sartorial niceties hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you	4.142704447847673
It was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic during the festivities of the Christmas season for choice causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation cases of which as he happened to know were on record in fact without giving the show away he himself once upon a time if he cared to could easily have	3.9376589235643866
Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at going hand in hand with his tuition fees	83.76776400682921
Not he parenthesised that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time	52.983169062837085
But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped	10.481131341546856
Besides though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree original music like that different from the conventional rut would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their	6.601948484081891
Yes beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and booking ahead give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house given a backerup if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs so to speak a big however with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows	3.0916909765830884
And it need not detract from the other by one iota as being his own master he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone	8.11130830789687
In fact he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort hung on to him at all	20.691380811147894
The horse was just then	410.6204064167453
And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed Bloom did without anyway prying into his private affairs on the step in where principle advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who he noticed was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present deprecate him or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person s character no pun intended	3.814128748283214
The horse having reached the end of his tether so to speak halted and rearing high a proud feathering tail added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish three smoking globes of turds	13.68874509537081
Slowly three times one after another from a full crupper he mired	7017.038286703832
And humanely his driver waited till he or she had ended patient in his scythed car	873.3261623828432
Side by side Bloom profiting by the with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains divided by the upright and stepping over a strand of mire went across towards Gardiner street lower Stephen singing more boldly but not loudly the end of the ballad	12.216773489967919
Und alle Schiffe brücken	126.99109556487812
The driver never said a word good bad or indifferent but merely watched the two figures as he sat on his lowbacked car both black one full one lean walk towards the railway bridge be married by Father	19.14481976169958
As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their à which of course he was utterly out of about sirens enemies of man s reason mingled with a number of other topics of the same category usurpers historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street looked after their lowbacked	3.4485331776221058
What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning	4026.008396445538
Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square west then at reduced pace each bearing left Gardiner s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street then at reduced pace with interruptions of halt bearing right Temple street north as far as Hardwicke place	5.722367659350217
Approaching disparate at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George s church diametrically the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends	46.415888336127786
Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary	3754.265101828748
Music literature Ireland Dublin Paris friendship woman prostitution diet the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets the Roman catholic church ecclesiastical celibacy the Irish nation jesuit education careers the study of medicine the past day the maleficent influence of the presabbath Stephen s collapse	6.812920690579612
Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience	873.3261623828432
Both were sensitive to artistic impressions musical in preference to plastic or pictorial	3727.5937203149383
Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious national social and ethical doctrines	83.76776400682921
Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism	7719.846677868277
Were their views on some points divergent	1780.428763062773
Stephen dissented openly from Bloom s views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature	26.826957952797255
Bloom assented covertly to Stephen s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus son of Potitus son of Odyssus sent by pope Celestine I in the year in the reign of Leary to the year or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt A D suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree	4.548777947003777
The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud perceived by both from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin at first no bigger than a woman s hand	5.722367659350217
Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative	7017.038286703832
The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees	2154.4346900318833
Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past	6919.7035378784885

Once in and once in with Julius Juda Mastiansky on both occasions in the parlour of his Bloom s house in Lombard street west	100.00000000000001
What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination	599.4842503189408
He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations	61.05402296585327
As in what ways	126.99109556487812
From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received existence with existence he was with any as any with any from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived	20.691380811147894
What act did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination	6173.41054643851
At the housesteps of the th of the equidifferent uneven numbers number Eccles street he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey	41.011270705513006
Was it there	21.840993118326033
It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding	316.227766016838
Why was he doubly irritated	410.6204064167453
Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget	599.4842503189408
What were then the alternatives before the premeditatedly respectively and inadvertently keyless couple	3727.5937203149383
To enter or not to enter	803.3290774201911
To knock or not to knock	803.3290774201911
Bloom s decision	21.840993118326033
A stratagem	1.1617274079423625
Resting his feet on the dwarf wall he climbed over the area railings compressed his hat on his head grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall	4.142704447847673

Did he rise uninjured by concussion	949.4860105710369
What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive	4293.13994636419
Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of CP a man lighting a candle of CP a man removing in turn each of his two boots a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle	12.91549665014884
Did the man reappear elsewhere	410.6204064167453
After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor	149.24955450518294
In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat with his candle	873.3261623828432
Did Stephen obey his sign	410.6204064167453
Yes entering softly he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man s back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom s house	8.11130830789687
What did Bloom do	97.6612821940667
He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone one for Stephen with its back to the area window the other for himself when necessary knelt on one knee composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M Donald of D Olier street kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air	2.589543080585877
Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think	1780.428763062773
Of others elsewhere in other times who kneeling on one knee or on two had kindled fires for him of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood Sallins in the county of Kildare of his father Simon Dedalus in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin number thirteen Fitzgibbon street of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at Usher s Island of his aunt Sara wife of Richie Richard Goulding in the kitchen of their lodgings at Clanbrassil street of his mother Mary wife of Simon Dedalus in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis Xavier of the dean of studies Father Butt in the physics theatre of university College Stephen s Green north of his sister Dilly Delia in his father s house in Cabra	2.081954996523886
What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall	187.38174228603845
Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies grey hose with Lisle suspender tops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction	4.840960141478948
What did Bloom see on the range	1643.043796432458
On the right smaller hob a blue enamelled saucepan on the left larger hob a black iron kettle	428.1332398719392
What did Bloom do at the range	1277.7037961367007
He removed the saucepan to the left hob rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow	36.51741272548377
Did it flow	21.840993118326033
Yes	1.1617274079423625
From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of million gallons percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of per linear yard by way of the Dargle Rathdown Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the acre reservoir at Stillorgan a distance of statute miles and thence through a system of relieving tanks by a gradient of feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge upper Leeson street though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer Mr Spencer Harty C	2.652948464431896

Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals why did he return to the stillflowing tap	428.1332398719392
To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington s lemonflavoured soap to which paper still adhered bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them face and hands in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller	8.11130830789687
What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom s offer	5912.555183224002
That he was hydrophobe hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal distrusting aquacities of thought and language	12.216773489967919
What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape stomach and thenar or sole of foot	5.179474679231211
The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius	5912.555183224002
What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress	2903.2601932065677
Dietary concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon salt ling and butter the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed	29.552092352028872
Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest	3727.5937203149383
Confidence in himself an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation	7017.038286703832
What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire	1333.521432163324
The phenomenon of ebullition	126.99109556487812
Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun primal source of heat radiant transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether	6.218001087320917
Heat convected a mode of motion developed by such combustion was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron in part reflected in part absorbed in part transmitted gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of thermal units needed to raise pound of water from to Fahrenheit	3.9376589235643866
What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature	4014.671278934556
A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously	1333.521432163324
For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled	7017.038286703832
To shave himself	21.840993118326033
What advantages attended shaving by night	949.4860105710369
A softer beard a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours quiet reflections upon the course of the day a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises premonitions and perturbations a clattered milkcan a postman s double knock a paper read reread while lathering relathering the same spot a shock a shoot with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered which was to be done	2.697953640073
Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noise	7017.038286703832
Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand	428.1332398719392

With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations	2154.4346900318833
Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster of the moon invisible in incipient lunation approaching perigee of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth of Sirius alpha in Canis Maior lightyears miles distant and in volume times the dimension of our planet of Arcturus of the precession of equinoxes of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which of our solar systems could be contained of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years threescore and ten of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity	2.091764655756996
Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast	4293.13994636419

Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result	7017.038286703832
Because some years previously in when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places e g the th power of the th power of that the result having been obtained closely printed volumes of pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units tens hundreds thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands millions tens of millions hundreds of millions billions the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers	2.289350193638287
Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race given in species and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer easier of solution	20.691380811147894
Of a different order of difficulty	949.4860105710369
Conscious that the human organism normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of tons when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage impeded respiration and vertigo when proposing this problem for solution he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian Mercurial Veneral Jovian Saturnian Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity	2.2758459260747883

Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come or times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give points in to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket Maria he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the big poppies because mine was the th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was after when I saw the Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take a st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him or tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the by going around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G th Bn nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the years more I have of life up to no Im what am I at all Ill be in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was of the wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery I went into of them it was so biting cold I couldnt keep it when was that the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no with the Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he made me spend the nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming for about minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half of those old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the W C I ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last Januarys paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get like Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their Rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs Stanhope sent me from the B Marche paris what a shame my dearest Doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice

write soon kind she left out regards to your father also Captain Grove with love yrs affly Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose theyre dead long ago the of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along I suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails listening to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow even in the opposite house that medical in Holles street the nurse was after when I put on my gloves and hat at the window to show I was going out not a notion what I meant arent they thick never understand what you say even youd want to print it up on a big poster for them not even if you shake hands twice with the left he didnt recognise me either when I half frowned at him outside Westland row chapel where does their great intelligence come in Id like to know grey matter they have it all in their tail if you ask me those country gougers up in the City Arms intelligence they had a damn sight less than the bulls and cows they were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed dear Madam only

Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near or a her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack flying with all her carabineros because drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing times on Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still about perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from Africa and that derelict ship that came up to the harbour Marie the Marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that was Gardner yes I can see his face cleanshaven Frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong that train again weeping tone once in the dear

bit on my side piano quietly sweeeee theres that train far away pianissimo eeeee one more song that was a relief wherever you be let your wind go free who knows if that pork chop I took with my cup of tea after was quite good with the heat I couldnt smell anything off it Im sure that queerlooking man in the porkbutchers is a great rogue I hope that lamp is not smoking fill my nose up with smuts better than having him leaving the gas on all night I couldnt rest easy in my bed in Gibraltar even getting up to see why am I so damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those mountains the something Nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with the little bit of a short shift I had up to heat myself I loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance I put out the light too so then there were of us goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow I hope hes not going to get in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again coming in at in the morning it must be if not more still he had the manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice I bought I think Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those lb pots of mixed plum and apple from the London and Newcastle Williams and Woods goes twice as far only for the bones I hate those eels cod yes Ill get a nice piece of cod Im always getting enough for forgetting anyway Im sick of that everlasting butchers meat from Buckleys loin chops and leg beef and rib steak and scrag of mutton and calfs pluck the very name is enough or a picnic suppose we all gave each and or let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who Mrs Fleming and drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats consolation I wonder what kind is that book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was what or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows theres always something wrong with us days every or weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about weeks I ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself and times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells wait quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats years ago now yes hed be though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the th card after that the of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the queens and the of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and red s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait I was married Milly is yesterday what age was he then at Dillons or about I suppose hes or more Im not too old for him if hes or I hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too in a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between s too in prison for Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our st death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for he can make it for Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only or Ill just give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the st man Id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him or times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then Ill tell him I want or perhaps Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do the indifferent or questions Ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze off what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get up early Ill go to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today I mean no no Fridays an unlucky day first I want to do the place up someway the dust grows in it I think while Im asleep then we can have music and cigarettes I can accompany him first I must clean the keys of the piano with milk whatll I wear shall I wear a white rose or those fairy cakes in Liptons I love the smell of a rich big shop at d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky sugar d a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he
