Title Ulysses Author James Joyce Release Date December eBook Most recently updated December Language English Character set encoding UTF Produced by Col Choat and David Widger START OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK ULYSSES Illustration Ulysses by James Joyce Contents I II III I Stately plump Buck Mulligan came from the stairhead bearing a bowl of lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed	5.722367659350217
A yellow dressinggown ungirdled was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air	467.9451991930079
He held the bowl aloft and intoned ad altare	2239.876139978818
Halted he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely Come up Kinch	279.0831983385544
Come up you fearful jesuit	91526.67094794934
Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest	2392.6540813771803
He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower the surrounding land and the awaking mountains	277.2448165463796
Then catching sight of Stephen Dedalus he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air gurgling in his throat and shaking his head	83.76776400682921
Stephen Dedalus displeased and sleepy leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him equine in its length and at the light untonsured hair grained and hued like pale oak	15.505157798326243
Buck Mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the bowl smartly	577.7613504134792
he said sternly	23993349.375869423
He added in a preacher s tone For this O dearly beloved is the genuine Christine body and soul and blood and ouns	106.5212624177669
Slow music please	3494580.912063223
Shut your eyes gents	412450.86248949345
A little trouble about those white corpuscles	12489.993079309948
Silence all	447262196.2410999
He peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call then paused awhile in rapt attention his even white teeth glistening here and there with gold points	46.415888336127786
Chrysostomos	3162277660168.3784
Two strong shrill whistles answered through the calm	4317.895736037542
Thanks old chap he cried briskly	27646.113889027358
That will do nicely	857255.312801234
Switch off the current will you	19836.492449446832
He skipped off the gunrest and looked gravely at his watcher gathering about his legs the loose folds of his gown	187.38174228603845
The plump shadowed face and sullen oval jowl recalled a prelate patron of arts in the middle ages	172.75419054371895
A pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips	5290.5312646651055
The mockery of it	717553.7578739247
he said gaily	22618707.63067886
Your absurd name an ancient Greek	20588.23928455205
He pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet laughing to himself	354.35627197971223
Stephen Dedalus stepped up followed him wearily halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest watching him still as he propped his mirror on the parapet dipped the brush in the bowl and lathered cheeks and neck	17.782794100389232
Buck Mulligan s gay voice went on	7241.765027120984
My name is absurd too Malachi Mulligan two dactyls	2531.5270645986197
But it has a Hellenic ring hasn t it	2798.807845478605
Tripping and sunny like the buck himself	7570.251022663128
We must go to Athens	182549.63508638623
Will you come if I can get the aunt to fork out twenty quid	425.4814871979829
He laid the brush aside and laughing with delight cried Will he come	693.5996851205707
The jejune jesuit	15958793.057757538
Ceasing he began to shave with care	6473.66590786929
Tell me Mulligan Stephen said quietly	28734.418717143522
Yes my love	13132406.06322197
How long is Haines going to stay in this tower	2188.2363334686224
Buck Mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder	1572.4767061491352
God isn t he dreadful	186975.92214077868
he said frankly	23993349.375869423
A ponderous Saxon	16375085.397560515
He thinks you re not a gentleman	20788.333974140023
God these bloody English	703375.2316196429
Bursting with money and indigestion	59728.34103696587
Because he comes from Oxford	121965.08947045368
He can t make you out	59895.72341788207
O my name for you is the best Kinch the knife blade	1890.8057022854732
He shaved warily over his chin	42939.247881134994
He was raving all night about a black panther Stephen said	1403.7760827816348
Where is his guncase	1011008.1847290986
A woful lunatic	15333356.051268084
Mulligan said	547968017.4709471
Were you in a funk	189970.9096897943
I was Stephen said with energy and growing fear	4120.9175235308485
Out here in the dark with a man I don t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a black panther	149.24955450518294
You saved men from drowning	108071.95145648537
I m not a hero however	46710.220131996546
If he stays on here I am off	6112.8994645886
Buck Mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade	4376.604730325518
Scutter	3162277660168.3784
he cried thickly	24812136.911825493
He came over to the gunrest and thrusting a hand into Stephen s upper pocket said Lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor	61.05402296585327
Stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a dirty crumpled handkerchief	312.6316730164415
Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly	17290.228413150107
Then gazing over the handkerchief he said The bard s noserag	1755.3014064137103
A new art colour for our Irish poets snotgreen	2829.8466624991406
You can almost taste it can t you	5564.550100224743
He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly	232.87138016674393
God	3162277660168.3784
he said quietly	16835961.34411756
Isn t the sea what Algy calls it a great sweet mother	818.3147312446532
The snotgreen sea	17549561.478375256
The scrotumtightening sea	15958793.057757538
oinopa	3162277660168.3784
Ah Dedalus the Greeks	690753.9358739905
You must read them in the original	19800.414485866768
	9.999999999999997e+19
Thalatta She is our great sweet mother	6683.9090531415295
Come and look	10882584.337579854
Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet	5996.8929761117215
Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of Kingstown	265.2230775686191
Our mighty mother	8795882.24357985
Buck Mulligan said	4089516.3211997002
He turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to Stephen s face	641.5262518398341
The aunt thinks you killed your mother he said	2735.8979870895664
That s why she won t let me have anything to do with you	567.388067635191
Someone killed her Stephen said gloomily	32248.315736921613
You could have knelt down damn it Kinch when your dying mother asked you Buck Mulligan said	200.7013539518661
I m hyperborean as much as you	12445.95072176028
But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her	250.9371726741061
And you refused	17141334.182267867
There is something sinister in you	24287.959194547595
He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek	1536.3374404279632
But a lovely mummer	1075151.1867433242
he murmured to himself	1133163.2438856596
Kinch the loveliest mummer of them all	6741.230982478597
He shaved evenly and with care in silence seriously	4079.057635972782
Stephen an elbow rested on the jagged granite leaned his palm against his brow and gazed at the fraying edge of his shiny black coat sleeve	71.09709432312432
Pain that was not yet the pain of love fretted his heart	776.9972013598505
Silently in a dream she had come to him after her death her wasted body within its loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath that had bent upon him mute reproachful a faint odour of wetted ashes	13.68874509537081
Across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him	145.48485860748474
The ring of bay and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid	533.214590305412
Buck Mulligan wiped again his razorblade	23077.48200503906
Ah poor dogsbody	8446865.067314724
he said in a kind voice	73802.00018788426
I must give you a shirt and a few noserags	4309.298346808508
How are the secondhand breeks	126787.91432417338
They fit well enough Stephen answered	26026.54170344407
Buck Mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip	3408.153973663978
The mockery of it he said contentedly	26697.933660343384
Secondleg they should be	247685.9321028112
God knows what poxy bowsy left them off	3191.1899553047115
I have a lovely pair with a hair stripe grey	3015.32745003968
You ll look spiffing in them	24879.472730268422
I m not joking Kinch	115851.6170986881
You look damn well when you re dressed	8042.454337730815
Thanks Stephen said	7036461.598948325
I can t wear them if they are grey	4504.12564967513
He can t wear them Buck Mulligan told his face in the mirror	1017.7713357067481
Etiquette is etiquette	3516029.7806246844
He kills his mother but he can t wear grey trousers	1780.430501151804
He folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the smooth skin	299.67886068561614
Stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its smokeblue mobile eyes	416.2398421874252
That fellow I was with in the Ship last night said Buck Mulligan says you have g	466.7831208818484
p	3162277660168.3784
i	3162277660168.3784
He s up in Dottyville with Connolly Norman	6209.043337899391
General paralysis of the insane	171482.13724622966
He swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad in sunlight now radiant on the sea	145.1135435773989
His curling shaven lips laughed and the edges of his white glittering teeth	829.2151727162384
Laughter seized all his strong wellknit trunk	6730.6061092430855
Look at yourself he said you dreadful bard	5492.147191012279
Stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him cleft by a crooked crack	494.72224447614354
Hair on end	5255901.1286964975
As he and others see me	36858.12777238719
Who chose this face for me	25107.515905335145
This dogsbody to rid of vermin	21995.101480898098
It asks me too	770824.5227520156
I pinched it out of the skivvy s room Buck Mulligan said	963.2105651647863
It does her all right	125020.00372947403
The aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for Malachi	3672.676605831682
Lead him not into temptation	62988.06982705777
And her name is Ursula	214970.76634381874
Laughing again he brought the mirror away from Stephen s peering eyes	1057.4610008824218
The rage of Caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror he said	552.701664572798
If Wilde were only alive to see you	4637.163182741355
Drawing back and pointing Stephen said with bitterness It is a symbol of Irish art	382.30532578148046
The cracked lookingglass of a servant	48255.75988735481
Buck Mulligan suddenly linked his arm in Stephen s and walked with him round the tower his razor and mirror clacking in the pocket where he had thrust them	46.415888336127786
It s not fair to tease you like that Kinch is it	934.5701378868737
he said kindly	20187243.8454533
God knows you have more spirit than any of them	2132.670761626399
Parried again	310118385.0482162
He fears the lancet of my art as I fear that of his	773.7190612150874
The cold steel pen	1091416.4569755832
Cracked lookingglass of a servant	72260.80373076083
Tell that to the oxy chap downstairs and touch him for a guinea	761.0902652416678
He s stinking with money and thinks you re not a gentleman	1005.5270660811306
His old fellow made his tin by selling jalap to Zulus or some bloody swindle or other	179.12487230033474
God Kinch if you and I could only work together we might do something for the island	428.458503059602
Hellenise it	310118385.0482162
Cranly s arm	4802964.595561739
His arm	1577647619.7647448
And to think of your having to beg from these swine	1458.9487675325145
I m the only one that knows what you are	3160.2832848274097
Why don t you trust me more	11315.64624020413
Is it Haines	10457281.825924471
If he makes any noise here I ll bring down Seymour and we ll give him a ragging worse than they gave Clive Kempthorpe	99.70101359499455
Young shouts of moneyed voices in Clive Kempthorpe s rooms	746.7725767867298
Palefaces they hold their ribs with laughter one clasping another	723.0703354521053
O I shall expire	1249234.0446436051
Break the news to her gently Aubrey	9799.864194951828
I shall die	24354129.3193987
With slit ribbons of his shirt whipping the air he hops and hobbles round the table with trousers down at heels chased by Ades of Magdalen with the tailor s shears	36.51741272548377
A scared calf s face gilded with marmalade	5477.647278821385
I don t want to be debagged	18560.05067256042
Don t you play the giddy ox with me	2044.60530857258
A deaf gardener aproned masked with Matthew Arnold s face pushes his mower on the sombre lawn watching narrowly the dancing motes of grasshalms	63.383642963333536
To ourselves	1685301719.4067605
new paganism	1616414935.6545274
omphalos	3162277660168.3784
Let him stay Stephen said	74546.09034831935
There s nothing wrong with him except at night	2925.5635576860527
Then what is it	773519.9931054953
Buck Mulligan asked impatiently	516672.33114611835
Cough it up	3480594.30308017
I m quite frank with you	27643.687249467595
What have you against me now	39292.15525549797
They halted looking towards the blunt cape of Bray Head that lay on the water like the snout of a sleeping whale	149.24955450518294
Stephen freed his arm quietly	157148.4012002652
Do you wish me to tell you	13962.141993117964
he asked	1388949569.5536497
Yes what is it	816706.2483913784
Buck Mulligan answered	6567688.691129389
I don t remember anything	142294.91601506667
A light wind passed his brow fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver points of anxiety in his eyes	109.88421772111782
Stephen depressed by his own voice said Do you remember the first day I went to your house after my mother s death	121.15276586285881
Buck Mulligan frowned quickly and said What	11645.410127605028
Where	3162277660168.3784
I can t remember anything	172413.93316202518
I remember only ideas and sensations	31568.84818965044
Why	3162277660168.3784
What happened in the name of God	22520.00724319527
You were making tea Stephen said and went across the landing to get more hot water	426.8877882409215
Your mother and some visitor came out of the drawingroom	2522.8022840509116
She asked you who was in your room	13711.119626508082
Yes	3162277660168.3784
Buck Mulligan said	4089516.3211997002
What did I say	1016154.9171462739
I forget	2325378237.020585
You said Stephen answered it s only Dedalus whose mother is beastly dead A flush which made him seem younger and more engaging rose to Buck Mulligan s cheek	46.415888336127786
Did I say that	792335.9144283413
he asked	1388949569.5536497
Well	3162277660168.3784
What harm is that	766384.4601545499
He shook his constraint from him nervously	14600.618249826108
And what is death he asked your mother s or yours or my own	581.6949462292796
I see them pop off every day in the Mater and Richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom	221.26088443470044
It s a beastly thing and nothing else	5989.0159110326085
It simply doesn t matter	141801.55875532457
You wouldn t kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you	398.1427527419448
Why	3162277660168.3784
Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you only it s injected the wrong way	349.5574569426262
To me it s all a mockery and beastly	4041.596310757725
Her cerebral lobes are not functioning	27177.31035800899
She calls the doctor sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt	467.2533398967602
Humour her till it s over	30523.649969874194
You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don t whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette s	82.76859773587134
Absurd	3162277660168.3784
I suppose I did say it	46387.51613670157
I didn t mean to offend the memory of your mother	1252.1058291923837
He had spoken himself into boldness	33783.41039135177
Stephen shielding the gaping wounds which the words had left in his heart said very coldly I am not thinking of the offence to my mother	71.09709432312432
Of what then	9583935.304965498
Buck Mulligan asked	6567688.691129389
Of the offence to me Stephen answered	12879.507769137832
Buck Mulligan swung round on his heel	13068.161612264108
he exclaimed	3504063901.5188165
He walked off quickly round the parapet	16903.796737416025
Stephen stood at his post gazing over the calm sea towards the headland	916.828728789741
Sea and headland now grew dim	14530.86843458835
Pulses were beating in his eyes veiling their sight and he felt the fever of his cheeks	298.60487884330655
A voice within the tower called loudly Are you up there Mulligan	1095.5950364277157
I m coming Buck Mulligan answered	37403.34167006464
He turned towards Stephen and said Look at the sea	3157.5013351532234
What does it care about offences	39223.03338205162
Chuck Loyola Kinch and come on down	6639.862276292462
The Sassenach wants his morning rashers	27564.327158226708
His head halted again for a moment at the top of the staircase level with the roof Don t mope over it all day he said	71.09709432312432
I m inconsequent	20518314.689567298
Give up the moody brooding	127925.53517158252
His head vanished but the drone of his descending voice boomed out of the stairhead And no more turn aside and brood Upon love s bitter mystery For Fergus rules the brazen cars	29.552092352028872
Woodshadows floated silently by through the morning peace from the stairhead seaward where he gazed	346.94575806824946
Inshore and farther out the mirror of water whitened spurned by lightshod hurrying feet	294.0570273330201
White breast of the dim sea	43594.784242204725
The twining stresses two by two	24930.71923297792
A hand plucking the harpstrings merging their twining chords	1575.541158278038
Wavewhite wedded words shimmering on the dim tide	3559.2416409516595
A cloud began to cover the sun slowly wholly shadowing the bay in deeper green	294.5483755307816
It lay beneath him a bowl of bitter waters	3457.462466682854
Fergus song I sang it alone in the house holding down the long dark chords	402.4285135897188
Her door was open she wanted to hear my music	2280.6008818281466
Silent with awe and pity I went to her bedside	1713.174686700608
She was crying in her wretched bed	15563.012823441364
For those words Stephen love s bitter mystery	4492.838019292071
Where now	1524186935.9862883
Her secrets old featherfans tasselled dancecards powdered with musk a gaud of amber beads in her locked drawer	100.96138736247931
A birdcage hung in the sunny window of her house when she was a girl	707.4803489302013
She heard old Royce sing in the pantomime of Turko the Terrible and laughed with others when he sang I am the boy That can enjoy Invisibility	61.05402296585327
Phantasmal mirth folded away muskperfumed	37915.3292451753
And no more turn aside and brood	11381.748678330292
Folded away in the memory of nature with her toys	2602.7618087188744
Memories beset his brooding brain	31301.76844552568
Her glass of water from the kitchen tap when she had approached the sacrament	721.589670488875
A cored apple filled with brown sugar roasting for her at the hob on a dark autumn evening	271.83922660425293
Her shapely fingernails reddened by the blood of squashed lice from the children s shirts	406.60129211553266
In a dream silently she had come to him her wasted body within its loose graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood her breath bent over him with mute secret words a faint odour of wetted ashes	17.782794100389232
Her glazing eyes staring out of death to shake and bend my soul	567.249175973108
On me alone	10872612.957071945
The ghostcandle to light her agony	33531.813809191255
Ghostly light on the tortured face	24511.395178076433
Her hoarse loud breath rattling in horror while all prayed on their knees	427.8444847739519
Her eyes on me to strike me down	8315.351604627012
rutilantium te confessorum turma circumdet iubilantium te virginum chorus excipiat Ghoul	342.75286842128276
Chewer of corpses	3516947.0744909034
Let me be and let me live	14443.830259105325
Kinch ahoy	963425326.4713724
Buck Mulligan s voice sang from within the tower	2632.871348180136
It came nearer up the staircase calling again	6344.604999724696
Stephen still trembling at his soul s cry heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words	201.66468157832907
Dedalus come down like a good mosey	23506.671358182735
Breakfast is ready	3514929.1245678165
Haines is apologising for waking us last night	2716.8924751825043
It s all right	566387.5143425908
I m coming Stephen said turning	47475.9226793366
For my sake and for all our sakes	8039.492665352996
His head disappeared and reappeared	95955.1901107316
I told him your symbol of Irish art	5726.091710348573
He says it s very clever	64182.93432031588
Touch him for a quid will you	11870.141911015002
A guinea I mean	852382.0717535598
I get paid this morning Stephen said	15133.986373358022
The school kip	19962912.843596965
Buck Mulligan said	4089516.3211997002
How much	739189927.3992728
Four quid	747365226.2100164
Lend us one	4582189.110187532
If you want it Stephen said	30783.075233054187
Four shining sovereigns Buck Mulligan cried with delight	3764.1435854881647
We ll have a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids	873.8915555184935
He flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs singing out of tune with a Cockney accent O won t we have a merry time Drinking whisky beer and wine	32.74549162877729
On coronation Coronation day	410012.02994585154
O won t we have a merry time On coronation day	1206.0283985594526
Warm sunshine merrying over the sea	17725.963844725753
The nickel shavingbowl shone forgotten on the parapet	6643.3007497837225
Why should I bring it down	29680.497880700837
Or leave it there all day forgotten friendship	6742.215997833333
He went over to it held it in his hands awhile feeling its coolness smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck	61.05402296585327
So I carried the boat of incense then at Clongowes	1631.5938906198899
I am another now and yet the same	7325.934434824967
A servant too	17317160.13137205
A server of a servant	225260.95767089442
In the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower Buck Mulligan s gowned form moved briskly to and fro about the hearth hiding and revealing its yellow glow	61.05402296585327
Two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor from the high barbacans and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated turning	32.74549162877729
We ll be choked Buck Mulligan said	9556.725724383521
Haines open that door will you	21679.154126099198
Stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker	20135.104172641153
A tall figure rose from the hammock where it had been sitting went to the doorway and pulled open the inner doors	149.24955450518294
Have you the key	690764.4876516203
a voice asked	24188198.205936518
Dedalus has it Buck Mulligan said	30387.45133829869
Janey Mack I m choked	69944.91118088506
He howled without looking up from the fire Kinch	5229.7971689161495
It s in the lock Stephen said coming forward	5221.29253057608
The key scraped round harshly twice and when the heavy door had been set ajar welcome light and bright air entered	139.60420640534088
Haines stood at the doorway looking out	17541.017256678428
Stephen haled his upended valise to the table and sat down to wait	685.0612632856318
Buck Mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside him	1209.9944497215881
Then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table set them down heavily and sighed with relief	166.4550601728533
I m melting he said as the candle remarked when	3133.034454182895
But hush	1965821856.7933984
Not a word more on that subject	16433.62112213034
Kinch wake up	7936540.039956174
Bread butter honey	5417013.935994594
Haines come in	9761413.483843822
The grub is ready	865425.6536609787
Bless us O Lord and these thy gifts	3419.2234230562417
Where s the sugar	996198.2835114398
O jay there s no milk	47762.89456380383
Stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from the locker	691.2910561899639
Buck Mulligan sat down in a sudden pet	7599.191114659883
What sort of a kip is this	19004.46144569915
he said	702914306.569534
We can drink it black Stephen said thirstily	6738.192631156685
There s a lemon in the locker	23038.03058021025
O damn you and your Paris fads	16532.95766382334
Buck Mulligan said	4089516.3211997002
I want Sandycove milk	1055734.7153687882
Haines came in from the doorway and said quietly That woman is coming up with the milk	471.3108699680173
The blessings of God on you	42962.708833679906
Buck Mulligan cried jumping up from his chair	5785.864539019365
Sit down	390722099.23233885
Pour out the tea there	87640.16683402566
The sugar is in the bag	76233.55774677459
Here I can t go fumbling at the damned eggs	2496.778868029486
He hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three plates saying nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti Haines sat down to pour out the tea	36.51741272548377
I m giving you two lumps each he said	2663.0333331023717
But I say Mulligan you do make strong tea don t you	774.2810136356351
Buck Mulligan hewing thick slices from the loaf said in an old woman s wheedling voice When I makes tea I makes tea as old mother Grogan said	52.983169062837085
And when I makes water I makes water	6571.403565974832
By Jove it is tea Haines said	11242.541318204152
Buck Mulligan went on hewing and wheedling I do Mrs Cahill says she	449.11615863110393
ma am says Mrs Cahill send you don t make them in the one pot He lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread impaled on his knife	36.51741272548377
That s folk he said very earnestly for your book Haines	1455.6061293374773
Five lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of Dundrum	241.234870844085
Printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind	1240.5544493785671
He turned to Stephen and asked in a fine puzzled voice lifting his brows Can you recall brother is mother Grogan s tea and water pot spoken of in the Mabinogion or is it in the Upanishads	20.691380811147894
Do you now	10351683.823672768
Buck Mulligan said in the same tone	15499.674664334301
Your reasons pray	8370715.172581812
I fancy Stephen said as he ate it did not exist in or out of the Mabinogion	507.89258410198045
Mother Grogan was one imagines a kinswoman of Mary Ann	1006.40184810138
Buck Mulligan s face smiled with delight	11881.932781141937
Charming	3162277660168.3784
he said in a finical sweet voice showing his white teeth and blinking his eyes pleasantly	357.2872432357522
Do you think she was	99709.73439237653
Quite charming	812648803.1611768
Then suddenly overclouding all his features he growled in a hoarsened rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf For old Mary Ann She doesn t care a damn	36.51741272548377
But hising up her petticoats He crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned	279.79368278686843
The milk sir	20322541.606501117
Come in ma am Mulligan said	24065.68160196306
Kinch get the jug	802783.7500117321
An old woman came forward and stood by Stephen s elbow	1884.0883509208056
That s a lovely morning sir she said	6546.684038641847
Glory be to God	302762.26341099653
To whom	1169350338.4497573
Mulligan said glancing at her	109909.67779493827
Ah to be sure	1004906.8405908549
Stephen reached back and took the milkjug from the locker	3164.945520028146
The islanders Mulligan said to Haines casually speak frequently of the collector of prepuces	561.0777726594656
How much sir	11951999.215172112
asked the old woman	966833.6538116229
A quart Stephen said	763468.1338125336
He watched her pour into the measure and thence into the jug rich white milk not hers	258.8472168313415
Old shrunken paps	7966180.065102182
She poured again a measureful and a tilly	6632.3158539270935
Old and secret she had entered from a morning world maybe a messenger	585.8623291514766
She praised the goodness of the milk pouring it out	2229.186432986091
Crouching by a patient cow at daybreak in the lush field a witch on her toadstool her wrinkled fingers quick at the squirting dugs	87.40832083020881
They lowed about her whom they knew dewsilky cattle	2736.390772100717
Silk of the kine and poor old woman names given her in old times	526.7803082948798
A wandering crone lowly form of an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer their common cuckquean a messenger from the secret morning	91.69814951430884
To serve or to upbraid whether he could not tell but scorned to beg her favour	251.29406808028068
It is indeed ma am Buck Mulligan said pouring milk into their cups	533.7472798910457
Taste it sir she said	48732.85546882577
He drank at her bidding	212812.94609771622
If we could live on good food like that he said to her somewhat loudly we wouldn t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten guts	52.983169062837085
Living in a bogswamp eating cheap food and the streets paved with dust horsedung and consumptives spits	171.77748790968812
Are you a medical student sir	26017.278719685433
the old woman asked	1679652.861655982
I am ma am Buck Mulligan answered	13276.979470424483
Look at that now she said	38378.715415038656
Stephen listened in scornful silence	103959.84878021681
She bows her old head to a voice that speaks to her loudly her bonesetter her medicineman me she slights	166.02095144946458
To the voice that will shrive and oil for the grave all there is of her but her woman s unclean loins of man s flesh made not in God s likeness the serpent s prey	22.456979955397745
And to the loud voice that now bids her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes	431.9468024528709
Do you understand what he says	35750.77717564795
Stephen asked her	14330285.873193536
Is it French you are talking sir	11477.132179611335
the old woman said to Haines	60454.705548069156
Haines spoke to her again a longer speech confidently	3514.1095644541306
Irish Buck Mulligan said	565643.2444151269
Is there Gaelic on you	79382.9128292294
I thought it was Irish she said by the sound of it	1760.9307056084463
Are you from the west sir	51715.594354881934
I am an Englishman Haines answered	33763.513950061046
He s English Buck Mulligan said and he thinks we ought to speak Irish in Ireland	434.4297022367483
I m told it s a grand language by them that knows	1234.514074780915
Grand is no name for it said Buck Mulligan	3061.029924700276
Wonderful entirely	620208081.1368749
Fill us out some more tea Kinch	7129.468408524565
Would you like a cup ma am	11511.950564260238
No thank you sir the old woman said slipping the ring of the milkcan on her forearm and about to go	187.38174228603845
Haines said to her Have you your bill	8759.356962680007
We had better pay her Mulligan hadn t we	2360.667071953245
Stephen filled again the three cups	47006.55953109427
Bill sir	447262196.2410999
she said halting	18553080.906029075
Well it s seven mornings a pint at twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling	32.74549162877729
That s a shilling and one and two is two and two sir	944.1898992959381
Buck Mulligan sighed and having filled his mouth with a crust thickly buttered on both sides stretched forth his legs and began to search his trouser pockets	61.05402296585327
Pay up and look pleasant Haines said to him smiling	2341.2072923456954
Stephen filled a third cup a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the thick rich milk	264.84040498983524
Buck Mulligan brought up a florin twisted it round in his fingers and cried A miracle	389.47441058564874
He passed it along the table towards the old woman saying Ask nothing more of me sweet	408.2430361224798
All I can give you I give	20971.232657041084
We ll owe twopence he said	20222.762134280678
Time enough sir she said taking the coin	5414.81551737363
Time enough	523114815.939154
Good morning sir	7214656.214641101
She curtseyed and went out followed by Buck Mulligan s tender chant Heart of my heart were it more More would be laid at your feet He turned to Stephen and said Seriously Dedalus	26.826957952797255
I m stony	20518314.689567298
Hurry out to your school kip and bring us back some money	695.3136914789156
Today the bards must drink and junket	6313.280657986205
Ireland expects that every man this day will do his duty	1219.296170012022
That reminds me Haines said rising that I have to visit your national library today	476.90398252016007
Our swim first Buck Mulligan said	18027.946334768225
He turned to Stephen and asked blandly Is this the day for your monthly wash Kinch	357.23573882659855
Then he said to Haines The unclean bard makes a point of washing once a month	298.98271175376175
All Ireland is washed by the gulfstream Stephen said as he let honey trickle over a slice of the loaf	230.35409503491107
Haines from the corner where he was knotting easily a scarf about the loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke I intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me	26.826957952797255
Speaking to me	4608154.104235367
They wash and tub and scrub	26531.831589113568
Agenbite of inwit	3891517.919872698
Conscience	3162277660168.3784
Yet here s a spot	168423.53221294895
That one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol of Irish art is deuced good	238.31224677597896
Buck Mulligan kicked Stephen s foot under the table and said with warmth of tone Wait till you hear him on Hamlet Haines	121.15276586285881
Well I mean it Haines said still speaking to Stephen	2034.9807331393733
I was just thinking of it when that poor old creature came in	948.8269940598196
Would I make any money by it	9525.949480361456
Stephen asked	1126695167.849028
Haines laughed and as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of the hammock said I don t know I m sure	100.00000000000001
He strolled out to the doorway	61970.45645453746
Buck Mulligan bent across to Stephen and said with coarse vigour You put your hoof in it now	198.7997195568841
What did you say that for	50948.55425183716
Well	3162277660168.3784
Stephen said	516320977.8552831
The problem is to get money	74058.45079642115
From whom	1301353828.8075366
From the milkwoman or from him	20101.181543482016
It s a toss up I think	13734.678751581943
I blow him out about you Buck Mulligan said and then you come along with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes	121.15276586285881
I see little hope Stephen said from her or from him	2026.1656925830955
Buck Mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on Stephen s arm	889.6122858303253
From me Kinch he said	79078.54239507885
In a suddenly changed tone he added To tell you the God s truth I think you re right	240.00949754835108
Damn all else they are good for	9736.081155766613
Why don t you play them as I do	3751.1734246298743
To hell with them all	112792.3082666966
Let us get out of the kip	18379.98066288331
He stood up gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown saying resignedly Mulligan is stripped of his garments	187.24417898281754
He emptied his pockets on to the table	7559.13341194217
There s your snotrag he said	25746.683516070498
And putting on his stiff collar and rebellious tie he spoke to them chiding them and to his dangling watchchain	228.04924538630124
His hands plunged and rummaged in his trunk while he called for a clean handkerchief	489.5703314986282
God we ll simply have to dress the character	3467.7584599326956
I want puce gloves and green boots	13798.169808555493
Contradiction	3162277660168.3784
Do I contradict myself	479414.8153334509
Very well then I contradict myself	21259.52992333672
Mercurial Malachi	354995759.26083565
A limp black missile flew out of his talking hands	2143.715221291078
And there s your Latin quarter hat he said	3486.4948030693654
Stephen picked it up and put it on	9413.640108943717
Haines called to them from the doorway Are you coming you fellows	1315.6964124189174
I m ready Buck Mulligan answered going towards the door	1958.6031149737641
Come out Kinch	10869939.656195926
You have eaten all we left I suppose	4449.980727847335
Resigned he passed out with grave words and gait saying wellnigh with sorrow And going forth he met Butterly	105.50555250825614
Stephen taking his ashplant from its leaningplace followed them out and as they went down the ladder pulled to the slow iron door and locked it	71.09709432312432
He put the huge key in his inner pocket	5179.191663498976
At the foot of the ladder Buck Mulligan asked Did you bring the key	621.7847759576781
I have it Stephen said preceding them	21894.962926370157
He walked on	12064408.001235783
Behind him he heard Buck Mulligan club with his heavy bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses	191.31240749374663
Down sir	812648803.1611768
How dare you sir	567310.4413074807
Haines asked Do you pay rent for this tower	3061.786070710889
Twelve quid Buck Mulligan said	49720.51940624273
To the secretary of state for war Stephen added over his shoulder	581.9536021840895
They halted while Haines surveyed the tower and said at last Rather bleak in wintertime I should say	164.11077176778375
Martello you call it	298159.9593482883
Billy Pitt had them built Buck Mulligan said when the French were on the sea	348.2362185821983
But ours is the	670358.6554870595
What is your idea of Hamlet	37729.02587295864
Haines asked Stephen	9771118.629577722
I m not equal to Thomas Aquinas and the fiftyfive reasons he has made out to prop it up	213.8718657270265
Wait till I have a few pints in me first	2489.7715126282633
He turned to Stephen saying as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his primrose waistcoat You couldn t manage it under three pints Kinch could you	61.05402296585327
It has waited so long Stephen said listlessly it can wait longer	876.3519663200747
You pique my curiosity Haines said amiably	10207.317026623683
Is it some paradox	708704.8333343599
Pooh	3162277660168.3784
Buck Mulligan said	4089516.3211997002
We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes	6571.759094975715
It s quite simple	986313.4118853008
He proves by algebra that Hamlet s grandson is Shakespeare s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father	121.15276586285881
What	3162277660168.3784
Haines said beginning to point at Stephen	10890.491223385665
He himself	2641325760.5757313
Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and bending in loose laughter said to Stephen s ear O shade of Kinch the elder	78.6928074445887
Japhet in search of a father	24668.469476003957
We re always tired in the morning Stephen said to Haines	1808.171686176914
And it is rather long to tell	19512.52263091338
Buck Mulligan walking forward again raised his hands	4225.1369826643095
The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus he said	550.4761349201073
I mean to say Haines explained to Stephen as they followed this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore	148.55805539446465
beetles o er his base into the sea isn t it	801.6932949041324
Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak	604.5556944810575
In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires	191.9437911318975
It s a wonderful tale Haines said bringing them to halt again	869.1193578780104
Eyes pale as the sea the wind had freshened paler firm and prudent	490.92565777883897
The seas ruler he gazed southward over the bay empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat vague on the bright skyline and a sail tacking by the Muglins	46.415888336127786
I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere he said bemused	2035.5570449481468
The Father and the Son idea	85460.05367329637
The Son striving to be atoned with the Father	4917.011978249428
Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face	1230.8093631148517
He looked at them his wellshaped mouth open happily his eyes from which he had suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense blinking with mad gaiety	90.03844470500793
He moved a doll s head to and fro the brims of his Panama hat quivering and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice I m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard	22.456979955397745
My mother s a jew my father s a bird	3596.2989349620343
With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree	9068.327171781015
So here s to disciples and Calvary He held up a forefinger of warning	465.27616106671024
If anyone thinks that I amn t divine He ll get no free drinks when I m making the wine But have to drink water and wish it were plain That I make when the wine becomes water again He tugged swiftly at Stephen s ashplant in farewell and running forward to a brow of the cliff fluttered his hands at his sides like fins or wings of one about to rise in the air and chanted Goodbye now goodbye	4.142704447847673
Write down all I said And tell Tom Dick and Harry I rose from the dead	296.1946738118187
What s bred in the bone cannot fail me to fly And Olivet s breezy	373.9281182797458
Goodbye now goodbye He capered before them down towards the fortyfoot hole fluttering his winglike hands leaping nimbly Mercury s hat quivering in the fresh wind that bore back to them his brief birdsweet cries	24.484367468222267
Haines who had been laughing guardedly walked on beside Stephen and said We oughtn t to laugh I suppose	193.29850376018916
He s rather blasphemous	1231477.2059116925
I m not a believer myself that is to say	2032.036067447639
Still his gaiety takes the harm out of it somehow doesn t it	585.4364443557682
What did he call it	134537.69190159242
Joseph the Joiner	7783595.873968138
The ballad of joking Jesus Stephen answered	9150.463079602403
O Haines said you have heard it before	10798.158128187271
Three times a day after meals Stephen said drily	3664.6299037183385
You re not a believer are you	11353.91994967059
Haines asked	781371915.4137927
I mean a believer in the narrow sense of the word	2160.281311901586
Creation from nothing and miracles and a personal God	2011.937984589273
There s only one sense of the word it seems to me Stephen said	723.3233724388846
Haines stopped to take out a smooth silver case in which twinkled a green stone	386.85844945360674
He sprang it open with his thumb and offered it	2434.528424957456
Thank you Stephen said taking a cigarette	14730.048896545051
Haines helped himself and snapped the case to	5747.782735192906
He put it back in his sidepocket and took from his waistcoatpocket a nickel tinderbox sprang it open too and having lit his cigarette held the flaming spunk towards Stephen in the shell of his hands	22.456979955397745
Yes of course he said as they went on again	3686.6482912356273
Either you believe or you don t isn t it	1230.1582493037772
Personally I couldn t stomach that idea of a personal God	1126.5883448227132
You don t stand for that I suppose	8356.307175317079
You behold in me Stephen said with grim displeasure a horrible example of free thought	354.15097987969597
He walked on waiting to be spoken to trailing his ashplant by his side	660.1302805086187
Its ferrule followed lightly on the path squealing at his heels	1005.5108500183267
My familiar after me calling Steeeeeeeeeeeephen	27699.477170488262
A wavering line along the path	38054.5162820351
They will walk on it tonight coming here in the dark	1500.4303764723031
It is mine	13916500.654387858
I paid the rent	1289131.8254062124
Give him the key too	152551.8275431533
He will ask for it	142678.37723600815
That was in his eyes	169983.16746806167
After all Haines began	527671.2912884319
Stephen turned and saw that the cold gaze which had measured him was not all unkind	543.9674210145677
After all I should think you are able to free yourself	1712.9928656815896
You are your own master it seems to me	2992.915511888674
I am a servant of two masters Stephen said an English and an Italian	633.8391591939829
Italian	3162277660168.3784
Haines said	473321249.555264
A crazy queen old and jealous	32508.313054960498
Kneel down before me	237194.2235666689
And a third Stephen said there is who wants me for odd jobs	917.0892196433172
Italian	3162277660168.3784
Haines said again	9650158.150694413
What do you mean	842069.8908557668
The imperial British state Stephen answered his colour rising and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church	255.9491014606649
Haines detached from his underlip some fibres of tobacco before he spoke	668.1738728193823
I can quite understand that he said calmly	9726.68566799927
An Irishman must think like that I daresay	6106.364433237054
We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly	999.1086084902737
It seems history is to blame	31691.02572150472
The proud potent titles clanged over Stephen s memory the triumph of their brazen bells unam sanctam catholicam et apostolicam ecclesiam the slow growth and change of rite and dogma like his own rare thoughts a chemistry of stars	17.782794100389232
Symbol of the apostles in the mass for pope Marcellus the voices blended singing alone loud in affirmation and behind their chant the vigilant angel of the church militant disarmed and menaced her heresiarchs	26.826957952797255
A horde of heresies fleeing with mitres awry Photius and the brood of mockers of whom Mulligan was one and Arius warring his life long upon the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father and Valentine spurning Christ s terrene body and the subtle African heresiarch Sabellius who held that the Father was Himself His own Son	7.2789538439831505
Words Mulligan had spoken a moment since in mockery to the stranger	747.2250165073463
Idle mockery	310118385.0482162
Hear hear	470843255.27814513
Prolonged applause	310118385.0482162
	9.999999999999997e+19
Nom de Dieu Of course I m a Britisher Haines s voice said and I feel as one	236.89331024192802
I don t want to see my country fall into the hands of German jews either	366.2387068803609
That s our national problem I m afraid just now	1872.3470143709612
Two men stood at the verge of the cliff watching businessman boatman	987.2387089046896
She s making for Bullock harbour	27705.280428339254
The boatman nodded towards the north of the bay with some disdain	1678.2670896931436
There s five fathoms out there he said	4773.306971469666
It ll be swept up that way when the tide comes in about one	638.9284508439569
It s nine days today	119138.43069710261
The man that was drowned	234767.74965271045
A sail veering about the blank bay waiting for a swollen bundle to bob up roll over to the sun a puffy face saltwhite	100.00000000000001
Here I am	8248058.842669083
They followed the winding path down to the creek	4648.640252343492
Buck Mulligan stood on a stone in shirtsleeves his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder	269.5612657599835
A young man clinging to a spur of rock near him moved slowly frogwise his green legs in the deep jelly of the water	100.00000000000001
Is the brother with you Malachi	40933.338867227154
Down in Westmeath	7242827.415673299
With the Bannons	12179818.986158265
I got a card from Bannon	57595.28037105785
Says he found a sweet young thing down there	2039.0701908134033
Photo girl he calls her	64549.86535102049
Snapshot eh	390722099.23233885
Brief exposure	310118385.0482162
Buck Mulligan sat down to unlace his boots	3961.9360058980756
An elderly man shot up near the spur of rock a blowing red face	329.16849622904357
He scrambled up by the stones water glistening on his pate and on its garland of grey hair water rilling over his chest and paunch and spilling jets out of his black sagging loincloth	26.826957952797255
Buck Mulligan made way for him to scramble past and glancing at Haines and Stephen crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips and breastbone	61.05402296585327
Seymour s back in town the young man said grasping again his spur of rock	300.98492817084366
Chucked medicine and going in for the army	5563.7775647059125
Ah go to God	1008667.2890617226
Buck Mulligan said	4089516.3211997002
Going over next week to stew	16834.268673035665
You know that red Carlisle girl Lily	9893.359173287454
Yes	3162277660168.3784
Spooning with him last night on the pier	7886.194819693025
The father is rotto with money	31267.683734501745
Is she up the pole	162712.4106800027
Better ask Seymour that	471170.26191126206
Seymour a bleeding officer	435996.09490822424
Buck Mulligan said	4089516.3211997002
He nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up saying tritely Redheaded women buck like goats	197.05918943086323
He broke off in alarm feeling his side under his flapping shirt	1051.8464167746956
My twelfth rib is gone he cried	9071.706313421466
I m the Toothless Kinch and I the supermen	3760.9690134043694
He struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his clothes lay	522.5556105874548
Are you going in here Malachi	29165.251361822742
Yes	3162277660168.3784
Make room in the bed	138960.84314919717
The young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes	187.38174228603845
Haines sat down on a stone smoking	17226.563422152838
Are you not coming in	83214.12947281057
Buck Mulligan asked	6567688.691129389
Later on Haines said	285948.6361933632
Not on my breakfast	1058492.9444515936
Stephen turned away	15341517.525172502
I m going Mulligan he said	29462.313578848913
Give us that key Kinch Buck Mulligan said to keep my chemise flat	530.039119313129
Stephen handed him the key	196596.3300674807
Buck Mulligan laid it across his heaped clothes	3794.812424301476
And twopence he said for a pint	29411.968345076795
Throw it there	4968132.425465515
Stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap	8774.5874608386
Dressing undressing	390722099.23233885
Buck Mulligan erect with joined hands before him said solemnly He who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord	147.16724278333606
Thus spake Zarathustra	4695832.530576019
His plump body plunged	713210.3918969516
We ll see you again Haines said turning as Stephen walked up the path and smiling at wild Irish	202.40850210901115
Horn of a bull hoof of a horse smile of a Saxon	1688.4032206077914
The Ship Buck Mulligan cried	139484.2343734908
Half twelve	781371915.4137927
Good Stephen said	9683511.033828028
He walked along the upwardcurving path	36350.98780627706
Liliata rutilantium	310118385.0482162
Turma circumdet	310118385.0482162
Iubilantium te virginum	3051623.7905530385
The priest s grey nimbus in a niche where he dressed discreetly	1012.2090072686628
I will not sleep here tonight	36444.82141239459
Home also I cannot go	58237.884963138196
A voice sweettoned and sustained called to him from the sea	1478.7695587154064
Turning the curve he waved his hand	5415.8741093875215
It called again	14569429.409925327
A sleek brown head a seal s far out on the water round	731.7329160724511
Usurper	3162277660168.3784
You Cochrane what city sent for him	8985.877470847992
Tarentum sir	310118385.0482162
Very good	652903792.247417
Well	3162277660168.3784
There was a battle sir	136663.8509375795
Very good	652903792.247417
Where	3162277660168.3784
The boy s blank face asked the blank window	3846.6862353374436
Fabled by the daughters of memory	28839.076381270042
And yet it was in some way if not as memory fabled it	876.9142908248713
A phrase then of impatience thud of Blake s wings of excess	568.3775915569754
I hear the ruin of all space shattered glass and toppling masonry and time one livid final flame	148.46528665432075
What s left us then	153856.36946412738
I forget the place sir	275041.8703845165
B	3162277660168.3784
C	3162277660168.3784
Asculum Stephen said glancing at the name and date in the gorescarred book	872.3195491534368
Yes sir	609078026.3901
And he said victory like that and we are done for That phrase the world had remembered	387.09634618445097
A dull ease of the mind	61934.65902294283
Any general to any officers	83786.87258030525
They lend ear	13208357.183973787
You Armstrong Stephen said	645555.2979880881
What was the end of Pyrrhus	61779.26373020206
End of Pyrrhus sir	320317.3087452043
I know sir	24031176.166662272
Ask me sir Comyn said	68497.88476970037
Wait	3162277660168.3784
You Armstrong	1702514282.373912
Do you know anything about Pyrrhus	26770.168284872285
A bag of figrolls lay snugly in Armstrong s satchel	1143.6341723905903
He curled them between his palms at whiles and swallowed them softly	710.7311941669257
Crumbs adhered to the tissue of his lips	6177.716360440441
A sweetened boy s breath	151195.90686098233
Welloff people proud that their eldest son was in the navy	944.4921619457443
Vico Road Dalkey	3140354.734135707
Pyrrhus sir	492272491.38334554
Pyrrhus a pier	5914018.589526226
All laughed	1742450348.0977805
Mirthless high malicious laughter	195306.70234330438
Armstrong looked round at his classmates silly glee in profile	1119.3853094330836
In a moment they will laugh more loudly aware of my lack of rule and of the fees their papas pay	153.26491103013743
Tell me now Stephen said poking the boy s shoulder with the book what is a pier	474.8224358208395
A pier sir Armstrong said	119176.62211234914
A kind of a bridge	327203.19251723407
Kingstown pier sir	4963621.278910806
Some laughed again mirthless but with meaning	8228.939135430808
Two in the back bench whispered	50803.87064215412
Yes	3162277660168.3784
They knew had never learned nor ever been innocent	2735.5100356466146
All	3162277660168.3784
With envy he watched their faces Edith Ethel Gerty Lily	1074.0377998022143
Their likes their breaths too sweetened with tea and jam their bracelets tittering in the struggle	207.67455463338058
Kingstown pier Stephen said	310716.86217552953
Yes a disappointed bridge	640601.1199537365
How sir	1642475108.6536322
Comyn asked	447262196.2410999
A bridge is across a river	32321.00975281667
For Haines s chapbook	705838.5722413182
No one here to hear	130929.5539682968
Tonight deftly amid wild drink and talk to pierce the polished mail of his mind	258.5046025479175
A jester at the court of his master indulged and disesteemed winning a clement master s praise	266.98338917882336
Why had they chosen all that part	10942.741858859805
Not wholly for the smooth caress	50927.77136780415
For them too history was a tale like any other too often heard their land a pawnshop	259.28186543793436
Had Pyrrhus not fallen by a beldam s hand in Argos or Julius Caesar not been knifed to death	129.00407759776178
They are not to be thought away	18253.168520913932
Time has branded them and fettered they are lodged in the room of the infinite possibilities they have ousted	283.7181103549921
But can those have been possible seeing that they never were	1416.705035478755
Or was that only possible which came to pass	3497.789589310611
Weave weaver of the wind	83393.6715811946
Tell us a story sir	127635.60562582978
O do sir	16921682.35673399
A ghoststory	2716259849.0038157
Where do you begin in this	31970.717348821665
Stephen asked opening another book	107936.55191379336
no more Comyn said	666286.1733683198
Go on then Talbot	605250.8318119813
And the story sir	993788.4427750048
After Stephen said	8805991.497955373
Go on Talbot	8003380.937353791
A swarthy boy opened a book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel	329.0375229078367
Aristotle s phrase formed itself within the gabbled verses and floated out into the studious silence of the library of Saint Genevieve where he had read sheltered from the sin of Paris night by night	24.484367468222267
By his elbow a delicate Siamese conned a handbook of strategy	639.2313601713771
Fed and feeding brains about me under glowlamps impaled with faintly beating feelers and in my mind s darkness a sloth of the underworld reluctant shy of brightness shifting her dragon scaly folds	29.552092352028872
Thought is the thought of thought	44100.54869350882
Tranquil brightness	310118385.0482162
The soul is in a manner all that is the soul is the form of forms	801.7872802972468
Tranquility sudden vast candescent form of forms	4242.791643720453
Talbot repeated Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves Through the dear might Turn over Stephen said quietly	105.88412316110131
I don t see anything	159649.22331473956
What sir	1893090845.8169544
Talbot asked simply bending forward	60147.80679244402
His hand turned the page over	41091.309588736156
He leaned back and went on again having just remembered	2629.5341387082453
Of him that walked the waves	31138.222523356562
Here also over these craven hearts his shadow lies and on the scoffer s heart and lips and on mine	150.8770940317692
It lies upon their eager faces who offered him a coin of the tribute	607.302439881867
To Caesar what is Caesar s to God what is God s	1090.3605331478032
A long look from dark eyes a riddling sentence to be woven and woven on the church s looms	210.8852275234435
Ay	3162277660168.3784
Riddle me riddle me randy ro	9667.737760708318
My father gave me seeds to sow	10813.373343816475
Talbot slid his closed book into his satchel	4050.8974203692082
Have I heard all	890137.7383975844
Stephen asked	1126695167.849028
Yes sir	609078026.3901
Hockey at ten sir	308256.9630406603
Half day sir	6972348.123891884
Who can answer a riddle	90964.96239343155
Stephen asked	1126695167.849028
They bundled their books away pencils clacking pages rustling	1534.3642366626948
Crowding together they strapped and buckled their satchels all gabbling gaily A riddle sir	156.74116392511712
Ask me sir	5363665.488260003
O ask me sir	1068758.6099747845
A hard one sir	874071.7435968315
This is the riddle Stephen said The cock crew The sky was blue The bells in heaven Were striking eleven	134.92778604849352
Tis time for this poor soul To go to heaven	1727.0672028207211
What is that	9186684.05249403
What sir	1893090845.8169544
Again sir	668090073.7856135
We didn t hear	973405.1352774684
After a silence Cochrane said What is it sir	3122.9416674644935
We give it up	840816.715147378
Stephen his throat itching answered The fox burying his grandmother under a hollybush	520.5778814121621
He stood up and gave a shout of nervous laughter to which their cries echoed dismay	311.25594111471526
They broke asunder sidling out of their benches leaping them	1796.7706289708256
Quickly they were gone and from the lumberroom came the rattle of sticks and clamour of their boots and tongues	172.7334290369775
Sargent who alone had lingered came forward slowly showing an open copybook	501.01440296407026
His tangled hair and scraggy neck gave witness of unreadiness and through his misty glasses weak eyes looked up pleading	115.73184193383703
On his cheek dull and bloodless a soft stain of ink lay dateshaped recent and damp as a snail s bed	95.56874278871247
He held out his copybook	214691.16154189775
The word was written on the headline	25749.543880792306
Beneath were sloping figures and at the foot a crooked signature with blind loops and a blot	198.03901597795718
Cyril Sargent his name and seal	19686.166086541674
Mr Deasy told me to write them out all again he said and show them to you sir	428.1332398719392
Stephen touched the edges of the book	20187.04060548395
Futility	3162277660168.3784
Do you understand how to do them now	7070.333998364241
he asked	1388949569.5536497
Numbers eleven to fifteen Sargent answered	12109.802055243044
Can you do them yourself	116289.0899458629
Stephen asked	1126695167.849028
No sir	1080528991.4825013
Ugly and futile lean neck and tangled hair and a stain of ink a snail s bed	155.63160771503948
Yet someone had loved him borne him in her arms and in her heart	681.9675819335756
But for her the race of the world would have trampled him underfoot a squashed boneless snail	326.84071141254543
She had loved his weak watery blood drained from her own	898.3811377246886
Was that then real	649743.0843055109
The only true thing in life	41005.305402362945
His mother s prostrate body the fiery Columbanus in holy zeal bestrode	558.8045529820527
She was no more the trembling skeleton of a twig burnt in the fire an odour of rosewood and wetted ashes	176.10228038797842
She had saved him from being trampled underfoot and had gone scarcely having been	421.4119249059521
A poor soul gone to heaven and on a heath beneath winking stars a fox red reek of rapine in his fur with merciless bright eyes scraped in the earth listened scraped up the earth listened scraped and scraped	17.782794100389232
Sitting at his side Stephen solved out the problem	2823.955708985094
He proves by algebra that Shakespeare s ghost is Hamlet s grandfather	733.8045332200189
Sargent peered askance through his slanted glasses	7136.282687750823
Hockeysticks rattled in the lumberroom the hollow knock of a ball and calls from the field	427.662728074484
Across the page the symbols moved in grave morrice in the mummery of their letters wearing quaint caps of squares and cubes	94.18583522575327
Give hands traverse bow to partner so imps of fancy of the Moors	505.81671458307954
Gone too from the world Averroes and Moses Maimonides dark men in mien and movement flashing in their mocking mirrors the obscure soul of the world a darkness shining in brightness which brightness could not comprehend	22.456979955397745
Do you understand now	638094.3298012571
Can you work the second for yourself	12757.088294452731
Yes sir	609078026.3901
In long shaky strokes Sargent copied the data	3232.6995413912223
Waiting always for a word of help his hand moved faithfully the unsteady symbols a faint hue of shame flickering behind his dull skin	86.61714607624856
matris subjective and objective genitive	28572.303271769088
With her weak blood and wheysour milk she had fed him and hid from sight of others his swaddling bands	141.9117590243593
Like him was I these sloping shoulders this gracelessness	2586.0262274283436
My childhood bends beside me	81903.82880209641
Too far for me to lay a hand there once or lightly	1126.47242680025
Mine is far and his secret as our eyes	2652.074424810258
Secrets silent stony sit in the dark palaces of both our hearts secrets weary of their tyranny tyrants willing to be dethroned	107.37142736163877
The sum was done	951277.72428312
It is very simple Stephen said as he stood up	2637.584270922872
Yes sir	609078026.3901
He dried the page with a sheet of thin blottingpaper and carried his copybook back to his bench	282.87129302623094
You had better get your stick and go out to the others Stephen said as he followed towards the door the boy s graceless form	83.76776400682921
Yes sir	609078026.3901
In the corridor his name was heard called from the playfield	1663.3955330904555
Sargent	3162277660168.3784
Run on Stephen said	393207.2305802947
Mr Deasy is calling you	101408.31641725436
He stood in the porch and watched the laggard hurry towards the scrappy field where sharp voices were in strife	175.77914664473698
They were sorted in teams and Mr Deasy came away stepping over wisps of grass with gaitered feet	141.92608181907516
When he had reached the schoolhouse voices again contending called to him	605.6690102334937
What is it now	878487.893295229
he cried continually without listening	132038.1947358579
Cochrane and Halliday are on the same side sir Stephen said	928.6572847104145
Will you wait in my study for a moment Mr Deasy said till I restore order here	310.790134619419
And as he stepped fussily back across the field his old man s voice cried sternly What is the matter	240.40991835099712
What is it now	878487.893295229
Their sharp voices cried about him on all sides their many forms closed round him the garish sunshine bleaching the honey of his illdyed head	83.76776400682921
Stale smoky air hung in the study with the smell of drab abraded leather of its chairs	253.05069508096298
As on the first day he bargained with me here	2869.5802407422575
As it was in the beginning is now	9281.645036579506
On the sideboard the tray of Stuart coins base treasure of a bog and ever shall be	192.79477879453628
And snug in their spooncase of purple plush faded the twelve apostles having preached to all the gentiles world without end	119.80861456119008
A hasty step over the stone porch and in the corridor	2322.013285064421
Blowing out his rare moustache Mr Deasy halted at the table	943.3509755367479
First our little financial settlement he said	5429.045558817714
He brought out of his coat a pocketbook bound by a leather thong	981.007287370839
It slapped open and he took from it two notes one of joined halves and laid them carefully on the table	176.8052277535132
Two he said strapping and stowing his pocketbook away	2591.2122814121235
And now his strongroom for the gold	17034.3366512659
Stephen s embarrassed hand moved over the shells heaped in the cold stone mortar whelks and money cowries and leopard shells and this whorled as an emir s turban and this the scallop of saint James	22.456979955397745
An old pilgrim s hoard dead treasure hollow shells	1534.1910827018423
A sovereign fell bright and new on the soft pile of the tablecloth	1115.5068249180222
Three Mr Deasy said turning his little savingsbox about in his hand	889.5531034286495
These are handy things to have	15618.938387328453
This is for sovereigns	681897.967374964
This is for shillings	681137.3985237285
Sixpences halfcrowns	310118385.0482162
And here crowns	17014974.143185362
See	3162277660168.3784
He shot from it two crowns and two shillings	3614.5219322638022
Three twelve he said	496202.97943861276
I think you ll find that s right	10222.07475425209
Thank you sir Stephen said gathering the money together with shy haste and putting it all in a pocket of his trousers	149.24955450518294
No thanks at all Mr Deasy said	12021.598231046319
You have earned it	667996.9113378897
Stephen s hand free again went back to the hollow shells	1611.801261815829
Symbols too of beauty and of power	11038.148689066558
A lump in my pocket symbols soiled by greed and misery	1146.9102695989736
Don t carry it like that Mr Deasy said	2986.1899665927804
You ll pull it out somewhere and lose it	3523.187466951627
You just buy one of these machines	17171.74666386263
You ll find them very handy	32090.535271081735
Answer something	447262196.2410999
Mine would be often empty Stephen said	8817.38507202271
The same room and hour the same wisdom and I the same	1292.7494082444132
Three times now	9053461.61186328
Three nooses round me here	71871.97902233727
Well	3162277660168.3784
I can break them in this instant if I will	3193.4831659632123
Because you don t save Mr Deasy said pointing his finger	1159.2303121441373
You don t know yet what money is	5024.802301039255
Money is power	5502747.630487911
When you have lived as long as I have	3521.780617404611
I know I know	1165667.8396622296
If youth but knew	599629.4681945269
But what does Shakespeare say	117918.35921156436
but money in thy purse Iago Stephen murmured	4189.875683731999
He lifted his gaze from the idle shells to the old man s stare	957.8889717462478
He knew what money was Mr Deasy said	6052.384512818314
He made money	20601150.585472506
A poet yes but an Englishman too	13501.488987037641
Do you know what is the pride of the English	3026.4469208367177
Do you know what is the proudest word you will ever hear from an Englishman s mouth	271.547017904276
His seacold eyes looked on the empty bay it seems history is to blame on me and on my words unhating	187.38174228603845
That on his empire Stephen said the sun never sets	3884.3842041555044
Ba	3162277660168.3784
Mr Deasy cried	14609179.86220082
That s not English	1078034.2292728913
A French Celt said that	98794.16263013035
He tapped his savingsbox against his thumbnail	13486.123654628143
I will tell you he said solemnly what is his proudest boast	1281.2400160001532
paid my way Good man good man	8296.176618166
I paid my way	835078.8937733425
I never borrowed a shilling in my life Can you feel that	1208.5909876476605
owe nothing Can you	309902.55971397716
Curran ten guineas	4593258.788418615
McCann one guinea	3503307.0952376626
Fred Ryan two shillings	234745.35254913318
Temple two lunches	5252403.498593687
Russell one guinea Cousins ten shillings Bob Reynolds half a guinea Koehler three guineas Mrs MacKernan five weeks board	93.68013101211136
The lump I have is useless	53674.30846986329
For the moment no Stephen answered	31516.85829789716
Mr Deasy laughed with rich delight putting back his savingsbox	1549.8976894512057
I knew you couldn t he said joyously	12216.131913788127
But one day you must feel it	16366.1813702814
We are a generous people but we must also be just	948.6439164750117
Mr Deasy stared sternly for some moments over the mantelpiece at the shapely bulk of a man in tartan fillibegs Albert Edward prince of Wales	83.76776400682921
You think me an old fogey and an old tory his thoughtful voice said	466.89429839738494
I saw three generations since O Connell s time	2908.042003909504
I remember the famine in	148545.36448447447
Do you know that the orange lodges agitated for repeal of the union twenty years before O Connell did or before the prelates of your communion denounced him as a demagogue	36.51741272548377
You fenians forget some things	88002.84409043437
Glorious pious and immortal memory	52009.19886550361
The lodge of Diamond in Armagh the splendid behung with corpses of papishes	325.54548406983366
Hoarse masked and armed the planters covenant	3822.5346666114638
Croppies lie down	3376033.4033608497
Stephen sketched a brief gesture	121294.05661381266
I have rebel blood in me too Mr Deasy said	2158.22867749286
On the spindle side	521543.9519537
But I am descended from sir John Blackwood who voted for the union	761.413778729278
We are all Irish all kings sons	8455.258170364952
Alas Stephen said	4276316.626454099
vias Mr Deasy said firmly was his motto	3957.5127574491735
He voted for it and put on his topboots to ride to Dublin from the Ards of Down to do so	187.38174228603845
Lal the ral the ra The rocky road to Dublin	771.2272447075229
A gruff squire on horseback with shiny topboots	3068.521294344794
Soft day sir John	371212.08351090545
Soft day your honour	320775.3967967639
Day	3162277660168.3784
Day	3162277660168.3784
Two topboots jog dangling on to Dublin	9333.70174221405
Lal the ral the ra	36114.53331634039
That reminds me Mr Deasy said	28858.31820641852
You can do me a favour Mr Dedalus with some of your literary friends	735.4226435207908
I have a letter here for the press	12887.57618029439
Sit down a moment	528615.9474096439
I have just to copy the end	15996.957445624634
He went to the desk near the window pulled in his chair twice and read off some words from the sheet on the drum of his typewriter	61.05402296585327
Sit down	390722099.23233885
Excuse me he said over his shoulder dictates of common sense Just a moment	460.8970720361225
He peered from under his shaggy brows at the manuscript by his elbow and muttering began to prod the stiff buttons of the keyboard slowly sometimes blowing as he screwed up the drum to erase an error	20.691380811147894
Stephen seated himself noiselessly before the princely presence	5498.818959640677
Framed around the walls images of vanished horses stood in homage their meek heads poised in air lord Hastings the duke of Westminster s the duke of Beaufort s de	41.011270705513006
Elfin riders sat them watchful of a sign	3267.268224764429
He saw their speeds backing king s colours and shouted with the shouts of vanished crowds	291.77497484756276
Full stop Mr Deasy bade his keys	7851.980206653459
prompt ventilation of this allimportant question Where Cranly led me to get rich quick hunting his winners among the mudsplashed brakes amid the bawls of bookies on their pitches and reek of the canteen over the motley slush	19.14481976169958
Even money Rebel Ten to one the field	3612.6883257436243
Dicers and thimbleriggers we hurried by after the hoofs the vying caps and jackets and past the meatfaced woman a butcher s dame nuzzling thirstily her clove of orange	34.051903741909435
Shouts rang shrill from the boys playfield and a whirring whistle	1250.6837288671447
Again a goal	6253707.954833771
I am among them among their battling bodies in a medley the joust of life	318.66388323364123
You mean that knockkneed mother s darling who seems to be slightly crawsick	606.9858290671853
Jousts	3162277660168.3784
Time shocked rebounds shock by shock	13509.913617272887
Jousts slush and uproar of battles the frozen deathspew of the slain a shout of spearspikes baited with men s bloodied guts	69.72354258586435
Now then Mr Deasy said rising	32553.8516030873
He came to the table pinning together his sheets	4038.0202473178792
Stephen stood up	12338015.274535762
I have put the matter into a nutshell Mr Deasy said	1677.0814467044208
It s about the foot and mouth disease	6582.475206307662
Just look through it	534699.221753049
There can be no two opinions on the matter	3712.885572981528
May I trespass on your valuable space	8144.940038932057

To come to the point at issue	22524.405361401852
I don t mince words do I	10350.889757575216
Mr Deasy asked as Stephen read on	10734.43112534315

Thanking you for the hospitality of your columns	6104.561650837225
I want that to be printed and read Mr Deasy said	1900.6340648426478
You will see at the next outbreak they will put an embargo on Irish cattle	401.7965406795451
And it can be cured	204883.6207513729
It is cured	14453559.623575233
My cousin Blackwood Price writes to me it is regularly treated and cured in Austria by cattledoctors there	149.8443424081171
They offer to come over here	36489.20354659321
I am trying to work up influence with the department	2798.418632812628
Now I m going to try publicity	16598.38209921342
I am surrounded by difficulties by	29216.797494501414
intrigues by	310118385.0482162
backstairs influence by	3445324.956454969
He raised his forefinger and beat the air oldly before his voice spoke	719.775045086354
Mark my words Mr Dedalus he said	9867.201855013283
England is in the hands of the jews	11463.45014991905
In all the highest places her finance her press	3464.494655978046
And they are the signs of a nation s decay	3427.887106621897
Wherever they gather they eat up the nation s vital strength	711.8222848191712
I have seen it coming these years	12816.472936827304
As sure as we are standing here the jew merchants are already at their work of destruction	281.87165786470706
Old England is dying	580430.6627657964
He stepped swiftly off his eyes coming to blue life as they passed a broad sunbeam	432.4483489996292
He faced about and back again	36540.86497601708
Dying he said again if not dead by now	3305.1422573162813
The harlot s cry from street to street Shall weave old England s windingsheet	317.5990854932767
His eyes open wide in vision stared sternly across the sunbeam in which he halted	347.19069423721294
A merchant Stephen said is one who buys cheap and sells dear jew or gentile is he not	219.40923103975007
They sinned against the light Mr Deasy said gravely	4306.313347203227
And you can see the darkness in their eyes	6205.363127464095
And that is why they are wanderers on the earth to this day	1259.1357618135678
On the steps of the Paris stock exchange the goldskinned men quoting prices on their gemmed fingers	188.4764207939268
Gabble of geese	3516947.0744909034
They swarmed loud uncouth about the temple their heads thickplotting under maladroit silk hats	310.31543234588804
Not theirs these clothes this speech these gestures	3438.961330227662
Their full slow eyes belied the words the gestures eager and unoffending but knew the rancours massed about them and knew their zeal was vain	60.971508368824054
Vain patience to heap and hoard	12132.838745022113
Time surely would scatter all	59442.46727160329
A hoard heaped by the roadside plundered and passing on	1708.0214008635235
Their eyes knew their years of wandering and patient knew the dishonours of their flesh	289.7759215236751
Who has not	11389037.115153255
Stephen said	516320977.8552831
What do you mean	842069.8908557668
Mr Deasy asked	10618922.996426107
He came forward a pace and stood by the table	2995.868341815488
His underjaw fell sideways open uncertainly	22949.96531225364
Is this old wisdom	656113.6384128089
He waits to hear from me	45461.64971588009
History Stephen said is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake	989.109310988805
From the playfield the boys raised a shout	4565.007678665742
A whirring whistle goal	791862.5273029733
What if that nightmare gave you a back kick	4299.433136800683
The ways of the Creator are not our ways Mr Deasy said	1187.8932658280744
All human history moves towards one great goal the manifestation of God	449.76605751884546
Hooray	3162277660168.3784
Ay	3162277660168.3784
Whrrwhee	3162277660168.3784
What	3162277660168.3784
Mr Deasy asked	10618922.996426107
A shout in the street Stephen answered shrugging his shoulders	2575.2744024161284
Mr Deasy looked down and held for awhile the wings of his nose tweaked between his fingers	309.6893066949416
Looking up again he set them free	10728.931309535888
I am happier than you are he said	6737.058808945671
We have committed many errors and many sins	3736.828101966943
A woman brought sin into the world	11521.686003157874
For a woman who was no better than she should be Helen the runaway wife of Menelaus ten years the Greeks made war on Troy	83.76776400682921
A faithless wife first brought the strangers to our shore here MacMurrough s wife and her leman O Rourke prince of Breffni	115.10252832581315
A woman too brought Parnell low	30182.966167106493
Many errors many failures but not the one sin	2650.512510429902
I am a struggler now at the end of my days	1749.6596000630257
But I will fight for the right till the end	4259.057456207746
For Ulster will fight And Ulster will be right	2739.959050662756
Stephen raised the sheets in his hand	15603.797299555024
Well sir he began	597400.843626704
I foresee Mr Deasy said that you will not remain here very long at this work	388.154837111673
You were not born to be a teacher I think	2266.2188329705637
Perhaps I am wrong	879278.4734992528
A learner rather Stephen said	94265.4287423679
And here what will you learn more	14762.759536952226
Mr Deasy shook his head	102501.03500789074
Who knows	959126797.1601683
he said	702914306.569534
To learn one must be humble	37637.22587159156
But life is the great teacher	78747.00875973691
Stephen rustled the sheets again	120598.87185666566
As regards these he began	87430.35162586176
Yes Mr Deasy said	552000.6631665933
You have two copies there	100978.0952673695
If you can have them published at once	4835.52519787918
Telegraph	3162277660168.3784
Irish Homestead I will try Stephen said and let you know tomorrow	1429.5160133987777
I know two editors slightly	121459.28708358256
That will do Mr Deasy said briskly	13068.614489679174
I wrote last night to Mr Field M P	4075.760348480962
There is a meeting of the cattletraders association today at the City Arms hotel	621.3422616354213
I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting	3002.0552730490094
You see if you can get it into your two papers	1878.9774840521889
What are they	15302946.127389776
The Evening Telegraph That will do Mr Deasy said	2613.455642875016
There is no time to lose	44842.72652170612
Now I have to answer that letter from my cousin	2564.4376923581085
Good morning sir Stephen said putting the sheets in his pocket	1383.7763138081875
Thank you	320128830.7674059
Not at all Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk	679.2930225189689
I like to break a lance with you old as I am	1184.010910482013
Good morning sir Stephen said again bowing to his bent back	1492.4953128567497
He went out by the open porch and down the gravel path under the trees hearing the cries of voices and crack of sticks from the playfield	61.05402296585327
The lions couchant on the pillars as he passed out through the gate toothless terrors	625.0438172718251
Still I will help him in his fight	11035.463232375136
Mulligan will dub me a new name the bullockbefriending bard	1830.9219812407248
Mr Dedalus	584097428.8992065
Running after me	4149573.3705494753
No more letters I hope	98590.28575122156
Just one moment	9666569.490681186
Yes sir Stephen said turning back at the gate	4591.020122326559
Mr Deasy halted breathing hard and swallowing his breath	1986.5393548120217
I just wanted to say he said	21187.275802498254
Ireland they say has the honour of being the only country which never persecuted the jews	353.27897945046533
Do you know that	436647.5770964189
No	3162277660168.3784
And do you know why	267896.1047189684
He frowned sternly on the bright air	22828.416184392612
Why sir	1502583154.004959
Stephen asked beginning to smile	147517.7753301107
Because she never let them in Mr Deasy said solemnly	2424.0605010826907
A coughball of laughter leaped from his throat dragging after it a rattling chain of phlegm	339.70474991867434
She never let them in he cried again through his laughter as he stamped on gaitered feet over the gravel of the path	121.15276586285881
That s why	8929625.326528696
On his wise shoulders through the checkerwork of leaves the sun flung spangles dancing coins	298.932508609239
Ineluctable modality of the visible at least that if no more thought through my eyes	384.0146922972314
Signatures of all things I am here to read seaspawn and seawrack the nearing tide that rusty boot	153.91752425287794

If you can put your five fingers through it it is a gate if not a door	367.94207760511983
Shut your eyes and see	89487.73194971473
Stephen closed his eyes to hear his boots crush crackling wrack and shells	669.8087262129873
You are walking through it howsomever	30433.037332562377
I am a stride at a time	14170.670384232842
A very short space of time through very short times of space	844.2928456308456

They came down the steps from Leahy s terrace prudently and down the shelving shore flabbily their splayed feet sinking in the silted sand	87.79396371520293

Looking for something lost in a past life	6253.496849802114
Suddenly he made off like a bounding hare ears flung back chasing the shadow of a lowskimming gull	171.26311362776528

His snout lifted barked at the wavenoise herds of seamorse	1438.661310671855
They serpented towards his feet curling unfurling many crests every ninth breaking plashing from far from farther out waves and waves	92.32675571093264
Cocklepickers	3162277660168.3784
They waded a little way in the water and stooping soused their bags and lifting them again waded out	174.63831705201204
The dog yelped running to them reared up and pawed them dropping on all fours again reared up at them with mute bearish fawning	100.00000000000001
Unheeded he kept by them as they came towards the drier sand a rag of wolf s tongue redpanting from his jaws	110.33410672389002
His speckled body ambled ahead of them and then loped off at a calf s gallop	343.029396500795

His hindpaws then scattered the sand then his forepaws dabbled and delved	462.767621481247
Something he buried there his grandmother	20728.743781472236

Did I not take it up	32329.80385025444
His hand groped vainly in his pockets	13021.747237417394
No I didn t	586874.9918130029
Better buy one	8181906.328976572
For the rest let look who will	10142.199600095404
Behind	3162277660168.3784
Perhaps there is someone	756140.0643835546
He turned his face over a shoulder rere regardant	4227.791421788627
Moving through the air high spars of a threemaster her sails brailed up on the crosstrees homing upstream silently moving a silent ship	86.13663061246183
II Mr Leopold Bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls	286.8338813255491
He liked thick giblet soup nutty gizzards a stuffed roast heart liverslices fried with crustcrumbs fried hencods roes	93.6538239343634
Most of all he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of faintly scented urine	132.60074282104128
Kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly righting her breakfast things on the humpy tray	204.68392830597912
Gelid light and air were in the kitchen but out of doors gentle summer morning everywhere	282.48583677945317
Made him feel a bit peckish	32717.085715568184
The coals were reddening	923356.0609696166
Another slice of bread and butter three four right	2184.0788431972533
She didn t like her plate full	13326.294240087642
Right	3162277660168.3784
He turned from the tray lifted the kettle off the hob and set it sideways on the fire	329.4426367833089
It sat there dull and squat its spout stuck out	1188.2283647819627
Cup of tea soon	450791.07409721584
Mouth dry	620208081.1368749
The cat walked stiffly round a leg of the table with tail on high	490.02557570330794
Mkgnao	3162277660168.3784
O there you are Mr Bloom said turning from the fire	2291.5323456207657
The cat mewed in answer and stalked again stiffly round a leg of the table mewing	304.55428165900673
Just how she stalks over my writingtable	7332.925057875575
Prr	3162277660168.3784
Scratch my head	4167618.37791119
Prr	3162277660168.3784
Mr Bloom watched curiously kindly the lithe black form	1797.2169591380275
Clean to see the gloss of her sleek hide the white button under the butt of her tail the green flashing eyes	149.24955450518294
He bent down to her his hands on his knees	4512.497933543707
Mrkgnao	3162277660168.3784
the cat cried	33086160.876829028
They call them stupid	1071770.8433869428
They understand what we say better than we understand them	1844.8451076942831
She understands all she wants to	24606.689052810772
Vindictive too	310118385.0482162
Cruel	3162277660168.3784
Her nature	1428865713.1478555
Curious mice never squeal	337146.7824520152
Seem to like it	256033.86660657986
Height of a tower	665116.3617015478
No she can jump me	119133.6860647225
Afraid of the chickens she is he said mockingly	5446.824916264817
Afraid of the chookchooks	1139472.338528398
I never saw such a stupid pussens as the pussens	2883.59619868267
Mrkrgnao	3162277660168.3784
the cat said loudly	1437564.458677259
She blinked up out of her avid shameclosing eyes mewing plaintively and long showing him her milkwhite teeth	175.88707030034251
He watched the dark eyeslits narrowing with greed till her eyes were green stones	435.5612299178975
Then he went to the dresser took the jug Hanlon s milkman had just filled for him poured warmbubbled milk on a saucer and set it slowly on the floor	41.011270705513006
Gurrhr	3162277660168.3784
she cried running to lap	140651.3613392342
He watched the bristles shining wirily in the weak light as she tipped three times and licked lightly	222.86173611559002
Wonder is it true if you clip them they can t mouse after	748.0668516061335
Why	3162277660168.3784
They shine in the dark perhaps the tips	8135.541133106657
Or kind of feelers in the dark perhaps	8518.438574428745
He listened to her licking lap	61726.16003185765
Ham and eggs no	353019.1074499459
No good eggs with this drouth	33273.51512578529
Want pure fresh water	413709.9576122069
Thursday not a good day either for a mutton kidney at Buckley s	657.9841945319623
Fried with butter a shake of pepper	5468.893003074696
Better a pork kidney at Dlugacz s	7059.661846512495
While the kettle is boiling	70748.9614888035
She lapped slower then licking the saucer clean	3393.2557925431547
Why are their tongues so rough	24852.8218488224
To lap better all porous holes	19399.259059326934
Nothing she can eat	542612.6151460913
He glanced round him	922750.0098223658
No	3162277660168.3784
On quietly creaky boots he went up the staircase to the hall paused by the bedroom door	376.6407595442496
She might like something tasty	131304.16925751415
Thin bread and butter she likes in the morning	1992.0604576068959
Still perhaps once in a way	33063.59289523537
He said softly in the bare hall I m going round the corner	986.2610678241654
Be back in a minute	146544.29498109387
And when he had heard his voice say it he added You don t want anything for breakfast	340.53591637141176
A sleepy soft grunt answered Mn	24234.81462786725
No	3162277660168.3784
She didn t want anything	138437.11794029485
He heard then a warm heavy sigh softer as she turned over and the loose brass quoits of the bedstead jingled	187.38174228603845
Pity	3162277660168.3784
All the way from Gibraltar	190011.28686600237
Forgotten any little Spanish she knew	12773.951899018644
Wonder what her father gave for it	10151.93494801344
Old style	1134458234.923734
Ah yes	590373622.4150964
of course	1315048758.9082263
Bought it at the governor s auction	10049.922518692467
Got a short knock	583052.7508635087
Hard as nails at a bargain old Tweedy	3720.077224741439
Yes sir	609078026.3901
At Plevna that was	509544.28161275137
I rose from the ranks sir and I m proud of it	1333.7346742382606
Still he had brains enough to make that corner in stamps	1627.2435996432748
Now that was farseeing	1297431.8181507038
His hand took his hat from the peg over his initialled heavy overcoat and his lost property office secondhand waterproof	198.15837796379708
Stamps stickyback pictures	3256818.0082208873
Daresay lots of officers are in the swim too	2487.6417580252755
Course they do	6182604.129835492
The sweated legend in the crown of his hat told him mutely Plasto s high grade ha	365.2675320582889
He peeped quickly inside the leather headband	9805.39023728887
White slip of paper	398377.22879085614
Quite safe	812648803.1611768
On the doorstep he felt in his hip pocket for the latchkey	1240.180985458059
Not there	1182502797.532064
In the trousers I left off	37844.56651598781
Must get it	8351013.358912063
Potato I have	4579276.281845168
Creaky wardrobe	310118385.0482162
No use disturbing her	570622.7256974806
She turned over sleepily that time	29584.641557830684
He pulled the halldoor to after him very quietly more till the footleaf dropped gently over the threshold a limp lid	137.93241793174968
Looked shut	492272491.38334554
All right till I come back anyhow	19461.92875539021
He crossed to the bright side avoiding the loose cellarflap of number seventyfive	737.6529605159126
The sun was nearing the steeple of George s church	1419.4166817924709
Be a warm day I fancy	29632.71540483185
Specially in these black clothes feel it more	2649.6531270095
Black conducts reflects refracts is it the heat	4109.516138251262
But I couldn t go in that light suit	5046.191950589927
His eyelids sank quietly often as he walked in happy warmth	1067.3009818490284
Boland s breadvan delivering with trays our daily but she prefers yesterday s loaves turnovers crisp crowns hot	81.4672007242834
Makes you feel young	544386.1375565059
Somewhere in the east early morning set off at dawn	1969.7895279407453
Travel round in front of the sun steal a day s march on him	431.71653105497603
Keep it up for ever never grow a day older technically	1433.1684220313707
Walk along a strand strange land come to a city gate sentry there old ranker too old Tweedy s big moustaches leaning on a long kind of a spear	46.415888336127786
Wander through awned streets	195630.60131978875
Turbaned faces going by	235493.44620210945
Dark caves of carpet shops big man Turko the terrible seated crosslegged smoking a coiled pipe	121.84512150695768
Cries of sellers in the streets	26890.780257088583
Drink water scented with fennel sherbet	13692.317021451023
Dander along all day	237618.7041670175
Might meet a robber or two	19875.61097456868
Well meet him	10584228.4023337
Getting on to sundown	688574.897293968
A shiver of the trees signal the evening wind	5272.545740345143
I pass on	24550500.00403832
Fading gold sky	3497249.045962364
A mother watches me from her doorway	19485.352721126794
She calls her children home in their dark language	4102.933102168347
Night sky moon violet colour of Molly s new garters	1204.5309188508086
Strings	3162277660168.3784
Listen	3162277660168.3784
A girl playing one of those instruments what do you call them dulcimers	762.1510635741041
I pass	3072897929.0638924
Probably not a bit like it really	17360.1251751594
Kind of stuff you read in the track of the sun	1524.7520154781141
Sunburst on the titlepage	787194.9707306419
He smiled pleasing himself	843064.7312586847
What Arthur Griffith said about the headpiece over the leader a homerule sun rising up in the northwest from the laneway behind the bank of Ireland	71.09709432312432
He prolonged his pleased smile	122634.37162777656
Ikey touch that homerule sun rising up in the northwest	1119.3241327839812
He approached Larry O Rourke s	27674.130108143036
From the cellar grating floated up the flabby gush of porter	768.1952681026037
Through the open doorway the bar squirted out whiffs of ginger teadust biscuitmush	331.50898450904435
Good house however just the end of the city traffic	2409.857906020089

Of course if they ran a tramline along the North Circular from the cattlemarket to the quays value would go up like a shot	100.00000000000001
Baldhead over the blind	553562.9680062716
Cute old codger	4178471.879631954
No use canvassing him for an ad	13781.172188767247
Still he knows his own business best	14051.371649329805
There he is sure enough my bold Larry leaning against the sugarbin in his shirtsleeves watching the aproned curate swab up with mop and bucket	81.99734625136531
Simon Dedalus takes him off to a tee with his eyes screwed up	814.6057421198401
Do you know what I m going to tell you	1769.1896184264494

The Russians they d only be an eight o clock breakfast for the Japanese	639.7240940755818
Stop and say a word about the funeral perhaps	4256.024887015406
Sad thing about poor Dignam Mr O Rourke	3965.861371841097
Turning into Dorset street he said freshly in greeting through the doorway Good day Mr O Rourke	258.6623362561161
Good day to you	736188.2693838947
Lovely weather sir	6251163.449674026
Tis all that	6339856.962092784
Coming up redheaded curates from the county Leitrim rinsing empties and old man in the cellar	269.3146757696225
Then lo and behold they blossom out as Adam Findlaters or Dan Tallons	311.7266793266758
Then think of the competition	315886.2307625797
General thirst	709942260.4600955
Good puzzle would be cross Dublin without passing a pub	1518.3068661379584
Save it they can t	75559.30598346061
Off the drunks perhaps	387817.4590060532
Put down three and carry five	20491.43093106557
What is that a bob here and there dribs and drabs	1429.4535666576821
On the wholesale orders perhaps	83727.21669099967
Doing a double shuffle with the town travellers	4856.838640282942
Square it you with the boss and we ll split the job see	666.0431294284191
How much would that tot to off the porter in the month	1099.8858905064583

Slieve Bloom	390722099.23233885
He halted before Dlugacz s window staring at the hanks of sausages polonies black and white	285.3156529073956
Fifteen multiplied by	4808170.261281964
The figures whitened in his mind unsolved displeased he let them fade	985.4176833696282
The shiny links packed with forcemeat fed his gaze and he breathed in tranquilly the lukewarm breath of cooked spicy pigs blood	88.31456652078944
A kidney oozed bloodgouts on the willowpatterned dish the last	1571.7568840362233
He stood by the nextdoor girl at the counter	5533.748901196553
Would she buy it too calling the items from a slip in her hand	438.98073671392984
Chapped washingsoda	310118385.0482162
And a pound and a half of Denny s sausages	2069.4450882814613
His eyes rested on her vigorous hips	14083.850180563266
Woods his name is	337617.85977434024
Wonder what he does	668224.2759185549

Strong pair of arms	526655.7296561213
Whacking a carpet on the clothesline	25323.518852463094
She does whack it by George	33857.67487040054
The way her crooked skirt swings at each whack	2693.0641964203214
The ferreteyed porkbutcher folded the sausages he had snipped off with blotchy fingers sausagepink	411.40825659831717
Sound meat there like a stallfed heifer	7520.047932038766
He took a page up from the pile of cut sheets the model farm at Kinnereth on the lakeshore of Tiberias	131.20724196574645
Can become ideal winter sanatorium	66941.0126370358
Moses Montefiore	1004444179.8077648
I thought he was	807364.1444909171
Farmhouse wall round it blurred cattle cropping	4906.114566560826
He held the page from him interesting read it nearer the title the blurred cropping cattle the page rustling	153.909429404015
A young white heifer	873014.0950926953
Those mornings in the cattlemarket the beasts lowing in their pens branded sheep flop and fall of dung the breeders in hobnailed boots trudging through the litter slapping a palm on a ripemeated hindquarter there s a prime one unpeeled switches in their hands	12.91549665014884
He held the page aslant patiently bending his senses and his will his soft subject gaze at rest	195.75127022470974
The crooked skirt swinging whack by whack by whack	2158.3355527592853
The porkbutcher snapped two sheets from the pile wrapped up her prime sausages and made a red grimace	235.77340730207283
Now my miss he said	81079.43304572898
She tendered a coin smiling boldly holding her thick wrist out	785.1816341563083
Thank you my miss	632330.3970974905
For you please	11556964.558132946
Mr Bloom pointed quickly	795920.7360908735
To catch up and walk behind her if she went slowly behind her moving hams	467.780672324049
Pleasant to see first thing in the morning	5640.6560436169875
Hurry up damn it	322921.62345853524
Make hay while the sun shines	30662.95574662914
She stood outside the shop in sunlight and sauntered lazily to the right	629.0185646298764
He sighed down his nose they never understand	8873.716980104013
Sodachapped hands	310118385.0482162
Crusted toenails too	3140354.734135707
Brown scapulars in tatters defending her both ways	1717.6305745295383
The sting of disregard glowed to weak pleasure within his breast	698.2248149018113
For another a constable off duty cuddling her in Eccles Lane	921.0705760935056
They like them sizeable	824343.1377333143

O please Mr Policeman I m lost in the wood	3203.683151421812

Then it fetched up three coins from his trousers pocket and laid them on the rubber prickles	323.01172080691055
They lay were read quickly and quickly slid disc by disc into the till	374.78021209533273
Thank you sir	5044868.067685076
Another time	729134299.302008
A speck of eager fire from foxeyes thanked him	1783.737573951313
He withdrew his gaze after an instant	12647.254928677852
No better not another time	122506.64647408266
Good morning he said moving away	45054.64767375043

Quick warm sunlight came running from Berkeley road swiftly in slim sandals along the brightening footpath	152.05761783171664
Two letters and a card lay on the hallfloor	6314.821942954643
He stooped and gathered them	122246.20433717662
Mrs Marion Bloom	7804532.691174756
His quickened heart slowed at once	19374.403571717154
Mrs Marion	764746959.1637523
Poldy	3162277660168.3784
Entering the bedroom he halfclosed his eyes and walked through warm yellow twilight towards her tousled head	150.01349172164353
Who are the letters for	187966.88703481996
He looked at them	834374.4663416076
Milly	3162277660168.3784
A letter for me from Milly he said carefully and a card to you	1003.8472919737429
And a letter for you	188092.13600489683
He laid her card and letter on the twill bedspread near the curve of her knees	403.7035945743732
Do you want the blind up	27859.92277381494
Letting the blind up by gentle tugs halfway his backward eye saw her glance at the letter and tuck it under her pillow	88.73392504593991
he asked turning	23035688.522802666
She was reading the card propped on her elbow	4360.078357307973
She got the things she said	47845.56211556441
He waited till she had laid the card aside and curled herself back slowly with a snug sigh	315.7341761450784
Hurry up with that tea she said	11113.961707588911
I m parched	20518314.689567298
The kettle is boiling he said	29857.953831854695
But he delayed to clear the chair her striped petticoat tossed soiled linen and lifted all in an armful on to the foot of the bed	71.09709432312432
As he went down the kitchen stairs she called Poldy	2392.8200408771613
What	3162277660168.3784
Scald the teapot	3516579.9501454746
On the boil sure enough a plume of steam from the spout	742.2837344086473
He scalded and rinsed out the teapot and put in four full spoons of tea tilting the kettle then to let the water flow in	83.76776400682921
Having set it to draw he took off the kettle crushed the pan flat on the live coals and watched the lump of butter slide and melt	61.05402296585327
While he unwrapped the kidney the cat mewed hungrily against him	639.4440302295612
Give her too much meat she won t mouse	3008.46631337619

Kosher	3162277660168.3784
Here	3162277660168.3784
He let the bloodsmeared paper fall to her and dropped the kidney amid the sizzling butter sauce	268.14032757891914
Pepper	3162277660168.3784
He sprinkled it through his fingers ringwise from the chipped eggcup	1657.1199482122352
Then he slit open his letter glancing down the page and over	815.2709986610051
Thanks new tam Mr Coghlan lough Owel picnic young student Blazes Boylan s seaside girls	190.86547197857806
The tea was drawn	974533.383777135
He filled his own moustachecup sham crown Derby smiling	3114.9400685288138
Silly Milly s birthday gift	72938.21176007406
Only five she was then	134749.7808179668
No wait four	13921324.708561465
I gave her the amberoid necklace she broke	5131.316041216329
Putting pieces of folded brown paper in the letterbox for her	995.8429223965394
He smiled pouring	19822910.352216437
O Milly Bloom you are my darling	18579.764196441305
You are my lookingglass from night to morning	4114.63457898454
I d rather have you without a farthing Than Katey Keogh with her ass and garden	319.36166475458276
Poor old professor Goodwin	497999.6588140271
Dreadful old case	4969019.234553846
Oldfashioned way he used to bow Molly off the platform	1496.717059622272
And the little mirror in his silk hat	9924.031528642117
The night Milly brought it into the parlour	8705.288382981873
O look what I found in professor Goodwin s hat	2367.6566417900995
All we laughed	12817828.953853
Sex breaking out even then	48493.578113715834
Pert little piece she was	38292.194065165815
He prodded a fork into the kidney and slapped it over then fitted the teapot on the tray	245.57300553477856
Everything on it	5219910.960450378
Bread and butter four sugar spoon her cream	2851.2023008720244
Yes	3162277660168.3784
He carried it upstairs his thumb hooked in the teapot handle	1573.5240194170124
Nudging the door open with his knee he carried the tray in and set it on the chair by the bedhead	187.38174228603845
What a time you were	168087.9218635786
she said	786444271.1958054
She set the brasses jingling as she raised herself briskly an elbow on the pillow	373.2954930445314
He looked calmly down on her bulk and between her large soft bubs sloping within her nightdress like a shegoat s udder	116.81452473687867
The warmth of her couched body rose on the air mingling with the fragrance of the tea she poured	316.227766016838
A strip of torn envelope peeped from under the dimpled pillow	1016.1715805284737
In the act of going he stayed to straighten the bedspread	900.561377464872
Who was the letter from	221002.0444577766
Bold hand	367684382.58433324

Rather stale smell that incense leaves next day	2380.4655531926187
Like foul flowerwater	9367191.46449275
Would you like the window open a little	6477.326392914903
She doubled a slice of bread into her mouth asking What time is the funeral	431.8862995111789
Eleven I think he answered	90099.01978923021
I didn t see the paper	53956.47568567468
Following the pointing of her finger he took up a leg of her soiled drawers from the bed	292.9914281968717
No	3162277660168.3784
Then a twisted grey garter looped round a stocking rumpled shiny sole	487.1024764376425
No that book	14005896.569870368
Other stocking	729134299.302008
Her petticoat	1428865713.1478555
It must have fell down she said	11908.827211247339
He felt here and there	133184.22161541035
e non	563503884.8737106
Wonder if she pronounces that right	23275.644926001285
Not in the bed	1442872.6587615667
He stooped and lifted the valance	41132.29865609444
The book fallen sprawled against the bulge of the orangekeyed chamberpot	1717.315816484228
Show here she said	453361.5862635378
I put a mark in it	44360.03157197555
There s a word I wanted to ask you	4205.261399913319
She swallowed a draught of tea from her cup held by nothandle and having wiped her fingertips smartly on the blanket began to search the text with the hairpin till she reached the word	26.826957952797255
Met him what	5229624.985624773
he asked	1388949569.5536497
Here she said	9953329.31408736
What does that mean	757796.1072389177
He leaned downward and read near her polished thumbnail	3338.6803637882986
Metempsychosis	3162277660168.3784
Yes	3162277660168.3784
Who s he when he s at home	9649.82690079238
Metempsychosis he said frowning	692614.0394849532
It s Greek from the Greek	50920.559297587824
That means the transmigration of souls	24726.315306805078
O rocks	1488421663.1826513
she said	786444271.1958054
Tell us in plain words	104175.07989526834
He smiled glancing askance at her mocking eyes	5759.541024463917
The same young eyes	1098005.1954191478
The first night after the charades	64641.18187890618
Dolphin s Barn	3932222.104851132
He turned over the smudged pages	45368.69373895128

he asked	1388949569.5536497
Yes she said	12297602.166400783
There s nothing smutty in it	21634.721506362504
Is she in love with the first fellow all the time	1881.5765228196904
Never read it	8711435.30206746
Do you want another	668897.1942680918

Get another of Paul de Kock s	7065.044321920605
Nice name he has	471660.65917249466
She poured more tea into her cup watching it flow sideways	1199.5407514442975
Must get that Capel street library book renewed or they ll write to Kearney my guarantor	203.96779919596028
Reincarnation that s the word	95097.59197963146
Some people believe he said that we go on living in another body after death that we lived before	217.82709817928136
They call it reincarnation	1185167.7375060688
That we all lived before on the earth thousands of years ago or some other planet	457.3710936020537
They say we have forgotten it	42122.72837656844
Some say they remember their past lives	8381.909822866211
Better remind her of the word metempsychosis	18058.547457931887
An example would be better	120268.03159525372
An example	974006832.8286825
The of the over the bed	119262.36048095571
Given away with the Easter number of Splendid masterpiece in art colours	688.7784914685883
Tea before you put milk in	25155.722609603767
Not unlike her with her hair down slimmer	7577.410466418568
Three and six I gave for the frame	10131.331122104346
She said it would look nice over the bed	5148.591001477077
Naked nymphs Greece and for instance all the people that lived then	848.8810953337414
He turned the pages back	179342.71291534405
Metempsychosis he said is what the ancient Greeks called it	1982.8538992544006
They used to believe you could be changed into an animal or a tree for instance	430.649508187678
What they called nymphs for example	33438.60116225707
Her spoon ceased to stir up the sugar	6033.61365137637
She gazed straight before her inhaling through her arched nostrils	1344.7635741178049
There s a smell of burn she said	5402.831075757219
Did you leave anything on the fire	15738.258698326956
The kidney	3251946400.2306504
he cried suddenly	24812136.911825493
He fitted the book roughly into his inner pocket and stubbing his toes against the broken commode hurried out towards the smell stepping hastily down the stairs with a flurried stork s legs	29.552092352028872
Pungent smoke shot up in an angry jet from a side of the pan	570.9037357578559
By prodding a prong of the fork under the kidney he detached it and turned it turtle on its back	202.51029054298127
Only a little burnt	1008481.2237171552
He tossed it off the pan on to a plate and let the scanty brown gravy trickle over it	223.88026674442773
Cup of tea now	450791.07409721584
He sat down cut and buttered a slice of the loaf	1543.0803101332892
He shore away the burnt flesh and flung it to the cat	1287.5550770768496
Then he put a forkful into his mouth chewing with discernment the toothsome pliant meat	269.0289712616588
Done to a turn	851513.0175739515
A mouthful of tea	719935.922072067
Then he cut away dies of bread sopped one in the gravy and put it in his mouth	260.45093738432297
What was that about some young student and a picnic	3078.7982885030324
He creased out the letter at his side reading it slowly as he chewed sopping another die of bread in the gravy and raising it to his mouth	52.983169062837085

At walking pace	9846908.36941554
They waited still their knees jogging till they had turned and were passing along the tramtracks	328.34372349028985
Tritonville road	354995759.26083565
Quicker	3162277660168.3784
The wheels rattled rolling over the cobbled causeway and the crazy glasses shook rattling in the doorframes	354.4372391553564
What way is he taking us	55588.68396105105
Irishtown Martin Cunningham said	278699.8313652622
Ringsend	3162277660168.3784
Mr Dedalus nodded looking out	101702.44370930486
That s a fine old custom he said	5150.850812315725
I am glad to see it has not died out	2832.573964297563
All watched awhile through their windows caps and hats lifted by passers	559.9802568437783
Respect	3162277660168.3784
The carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the smoother road past Watery lane	730.9825073000335
There s a friend of yours gone by Dedalus he said	1065.7819281184286
Who is that	8695755.441731455
Your son and heir	651209.9701756674
Where is he	6917032.735464732
Mr Dedalus said stretching over across	23216.820067818666
The carriage passing the open drains and mounds of rippedup roadway before the tenement houses lurched round the corner and swerving back to the tramtrack rolled on noisily with chattering wheels	36.51741272548377
Mr Dedalus fell back saying Was that Mulligan cad with him	877.5480634332561
His	3162277660168.3784
No Mr Bloom said	536120.0923931134
He was alone	20715913.87681977
Down with his aunt Sally I suppose Mr Dedalus said the Goulding faction the drunken little costdrawer and Crissie papa s little lump of dung the wise child that knows her own father	29.552092352028872
Mr Bloom smiled joylessly on Ringsend road	7761.777935816716
Wallace Bros the bottleworks Dodder bridge	8052.56612755526
Richie Goulding and the legal bag	43098.0761585959
Goulding Collis and Ward he calls the firm	3383.555479506198
His jokes are getting a bit damp	14227.039998185906
Great card he was	430873.6659734056
Waltzing in Stamer street with Ignatius Gallaher on a Sunday morning the landlady s two hats pinned on his head	111.00871836308953
Out on the rampage all night	32928.816788117045
Beginning to tell on him now that backache of his I fear	1012.0533932703399
Wife ironing his back	345684.5649468209
Thinks he ll cure it with pills	8986.664832718476
All breadcrumbs they are	543514.748150416
About six hundred per cent profit	19513.23546068206
He s in with a lowdown crowd Mr Dedalus snarled	3398.5711015513916
That Mulligan is a contaminated bloody doubledyed ruffian by all accounts	1127.736914813046
His name stinks all over Dublin	36614.10293063323
But with the help of God and His blessed mother I ll make it my business to write a letter one of those days to his mother or his aunt or whatever she is that will open her eye as wide as a gate	12.91549665014884
I ll tickle his catastrophe believe you me	4520.914538085201
He cried above the clatter of the wheels I won t have her bastard of a nephew ruin my son	212.28080984559017
A counterjumper s son	718955.5441363404
Selling tapes in my cousin Peter Paul M Swiney s	919.9331915037617
Not likely	1182502797.532064
He ceased	2641325760.5757313
Mr Bloom glanced from his angry moustache to Mr Power s mild face and Martin Cunningham s eyes and beard gravely shaking	149.24955450518294
Noisy selfwilled man	3011649.108042566
Full of his son	935465.9068225293
He is right	19578491.652273864
Something to hand on	563369.5132629256
If little Rudy had lived	99769.74731690974
See him grow up	516181.28660958674
Hear his voice in the house	35172.52763660273
Walking beside Molly in an Eton suit	7815.373211009952
My son	1203412552.924437
Me in his eyes	737864.7871664623
Strange feeling it would be	65944.36021229185
From me	1033137530.0508792
Just a chance	9659104.281052439
Must have been that morning in Raymond terrace she was at the window watching the two dogs at it by the wall of the cease to do evil	52.983169062837085
And the sergeant grinning up	103619.03728190468
She had that cream gown on with the rip she never stitched	1081.2788208970014
Give us a touch Poldy	109330.8903619343
God I m dying for it	41059.052284276084

Got big then	8126660.774657544
Had to refuse the Greystones concert	14467.045648223977
My son inside her	591894.0628799053
I could have helped him on in life	8858.487069381257
I could	1126695167.849028
Make him independent	7025966.498806041
Learn German too	4548406.419190588
Are we late	9437296.951178022
Mr Power asked	9920858.139356378
Ten minutes Martin Cunningham said looking at his watch	3221.189311790205
Molly	3162277660168.3784
Milly	3162277660168.3784

Her tomboy oaths	9471140.870070295
O jumping Jupiter	15977647.160264727

Yes yes a woman too	181798.9157423301
Life life	709942260.4600955
The carriage heeled over and back their four trunks swaying	1697.156894640987
Corny might have given us a more commodious yoke Mr Power said	725.9690589492914
He might Mr Dedalus said if he hadn t that squint troubling him	798.6382891762823
Do you follow me	484836.824117875
He closed his left eye	187802.20370083072
Martin Cunningham began to brush away crustcrumbs from under his thighs	980.9202957368975
What is this he said in the name of God	3143.6496728862694
Crumbs	3162277660168.3784
Someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately Mr Power said	374.93717446760724
All raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless leather of the seats	296.62916195516584
Mr Dedalus twisting his nose frowned downward and said Unless I m greatly mistaken	502.15801307734984
What do you think Martin	161433.05573004155
It struck me too Martin Cunningham said	9572.608848642023
Mr Bloom set his thigh down	37675.014484426625
Feel my feet quite clean	78837.03730790496
But I wish Mrs Fleming had darned these socks better	1344.1540264957655
Mr Dedalus sighed resignedly	735708.881982659
After all he said it s the most natural thing in the world	1277.8837064209918
Did Tom Kernan turn up	105663.31908943116
Martin Cunningham asked twirling the peak of his beard gently	1528.2750537574993
Yes Mr Bloom answered	793225.1610103581
He s behind with Ned Lambert and Hynes	6991.926672740181
And Corny Kelleher himself	1173713.2481956524
Mr Power asked	9920858.139356378
At the cemetery Martin Cunningham said	18714.24274364312
I met M Coy this morning Mr Bloom said	3856.755994416277
He said he d try to come	21100.557670602033
The carriage halted short	890247.3334429323
What s wrong	12198439.539762978
We re stopped	11963969.721669914
Where are we	8599896.26813652
Mr Bloom put his head out of the window	5167.7241569711905
The grand canal he said	120803.24388769425
Gasworks	3162277660168.3784
Whooping cough they say it cures	20379.234268571967
Good job Milly never got it	21994.738790426665
Poor children	1086166761.5235136
Doubles them up black and blue in convulsions	3810.5848069738
Shame really	492272491.38334554
Got off lightly with illnesses compared	16819.02079402366
Only measles	1004444179.8077648
Flaxseed tea	310118385.0482162
Scarlatina influenza epidemics	2738660.1617968753

Don t miss this chance	77447.35320446808
Dogs home over there	312608.3508270064
Poor old Athos	8962166.08475991
Be good to Athos Leopold is my last wish	2592.8786550583827
Thy will be done	542215.3105517717
A dying scrawl	17680903.03621127
He took it to heart pined away	20387.803548380656
Quiet brute	447262196.2410999
Old men s dogs usually are	26089.163031736236
A raindrop spat on his hat	33826.46287782771
He drew back and saw an instant of shower spray dots over the grey flags	515.4484967542364
Apart	3162277660168.3784
Curious	3162277660168.3784
Like through a colander	960286.4378593583
I thought it would	986541.0085187977
The weather is changing he said quietly	15181.789259353523
A pity it did not keep up fine Martin Cunningham said	1147.1261488093598
Wanted for the country Mr Power said	12956.460457108036
There s the sun again coming out	16322.916231349574
Mr Dedalus peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun hurled a mute curse at the sky	266.19057734797394
It s as uncertain as a child s bottom he said	1348.5632225127827
We re off again	635464.8611461177
The carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed gently	635.0992101404835
Martin Cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard	1371.134435677734
Tom Kernan was immense last night he said	4042.5925678385706
And Paddy Leonard taking him off to his face	4994.024923653431
O draw him out Martin Mr Power said eagerly	3515.148261813515
Wait till you hear him Simon on Ben Dollard s singing of Croppy	501.58190743520333
Immense Martin Cunningham said pompously	67641.30666700064
singing of that simple ballad Martin is the most trenchant rendering I ever heard in the whole course of my experience Trenchant Mr Power said laughing	71.09709432312432
He s dead nuts on that	32758.462602393876
And the retrospective arrangement	724182.1817419667
Did you read Dan Dawson s speech	8172.9730349421825
Martin Cunningham asked	6239909.696467083
I did not then Mr Dedalus said	14344.16383804216
Where is it	9098716.234998422
In the paper this morning	150241.06696252926
Mr Bloom took the paper from his inside pocket	5105.291446934839
That book I must change for her	15338.294572591461
Later on please	4180804.9025418935
Mr Bloom s glance travelled down the edge of the paper scanning the deaths Callan Coleman Dignam Fawcett Lowry Naumann Peake what Peake is that	68.71191140356879
is it the chap was in Crosbie and Alleyne s	2279.263138863494

Where did I put her letter after I read it in the bath	930.8818346347346
He patted his waistcoatpocket	875599.7383896946
There all right	12446288.874677124

Too much bone in their skulls	30317.797595321812
The other trotting round with a fare	21728.542162073656
An hour ago I was passing there	14158.957904876048
The jarvies raised their hats	134140.6148264844
A pointsman s back straightened itself upright suddenly against a tramway standard by Mr Bloom s window	207.90931151781677
Couldn t they invent something automatic so that the wheel itself much handier	500.3576058120232
Well but that fellow would lose his job then	3012.0169009536858
Well but then another fellow would get a job making the new invention	805.3616113446188

As broad as it s long	45998.0325839677

How do you do	505544.03951711825
Martin Cunningham said raising his palm to his brow in salute	1222.183231768536
He doesn t see us Mr Power said	6369.747678899404
Yes he does	12908053.575619834
How do you do	505544.03951711825
Who	3162277660168.3784
Mr Dedalus asked	9701556.400784489
Blazes Boylan Mr Power said	65679.58083986306
There he is airing his quiff	27471.264803350332
Just that moment I was thinking	42399.96017847328
Mr Dedalus bent across to salute	29025.372634314037
From the door of the Red Bank the white disc of a straw hat flashed reply spruce figure passed	206.2491877461383
Mr Bloom reviewed the nails of his left hand then those of his right hand	483.76276634617426
The nails yes	19909851.51099155
Is there anything more in him that they she sees	2668.0741246666694
Fascination	3162277660168.3784
Worst man in Dublin	522189.30836232187
That keeps him alive	726202.8998496948
They sometimes feel what a person is	14054.913712962763
Instinct	3162277660168.3784
But a type like that	92969.43824424589
My nails	1515619770.410867
I am just looking at them well pared	8800.314019228012
And after thinking alone	840573.7558943206
Body getting a bit softy	95804.94608644528
I would notice that from remembering	53374.96496215495
What causes that	15234252.89870971
I suppose the skin can t contract quickly enough when the flesh falls off	584.0911566513674
But the shape is there	125728.76398040095
The shape is there still	189083.28006795127
Shoulders	3162277660168.3784
Hips	3162277660168.3784
Plump	3162277660168.3784
Night of the dance dressing	214755.82841684262
Shift stuck between the cheeks behind	18224.05234987105
He clasped his hands between his knees and satisfied sent his vacant glance over their faces	291.00327758053305
Mr Power asked How is the concert tour getting on Bloom	1505.5212918761965
O very well Mr Bloom said	33030.51234838761
I hear great accounts of it	33805.036978945944
It s a good idea you see	13430.5560676186
Are you going yourself	558047.5914898221
Well no Mr Bloom said	92392.13790477683
In point of fact I have to go down to the county Clare on some private business	418.87581655547984
You see the idea is to tour the chief towns	2585.1764439071253
What you lose on one you can make up on the other	1270.5576733962253
Quite so Martin Cunningham said	54325.94089029747
Mary Anderson is up there now	29894.301726792386
Have you good artists	715027.2026523079

Doyle and John MacCormack I hope and	7245.367183008414
The best in fact	964793.1592335997
And Mr Power said smiling	178238.80371647235
Last but not least	617410.8891868155
Mr Bloom unclasped his hands in a gesture of soft politeness and clasped them	497.02944812875864
Smith O Brien	4603944.477822997
Someone has laid a bunch of flowers there	3332.5154624993547

Must be his deathday	809537.7079255785
For many happy returns	610622.4185912034
The carriage wheeling by Farrell s statue united noiselessly their unresisting knees	481.5660518292282
Oot a dullgarbed old man from the curbstone tendered his wares his mouth opening oot	293.29340808946637
Four bootlaces for a penny	87728.61560099293
Wonder why he was struck off the rolls	9716.649919061092
Had his office in Hume street	18216.81316211946
Same house as Molly s namesake Tweedy crown solicitor for Waterford	658.6321806952994
Has that silk hat ever since	22108.666686185057
Relics of old decency	420467.061505511
Mourning too	390722099.23233885
Terrible comedown poor wretch	311201.2380512547
Kicked about like snuff at a wake	6265.326488579441
And	3162277660168.3784
Twenty past eleven	6039289.650777868
Up	3162277660168.3784
Mrs Fleming is in to clean	48185.07818828445
Doing her hair humming e non	19969.52103128834
No e	1960714923.84297

Beautiful on that her voice is weeping tone	5146.075666754111
A thrush	2160704855.010257
A throstle	2160704855.010257
There is a word throstle that expresses that	5651.02996258147
His eyes passed lightly over Mr Power s goodlooking face	1427.2597598880297
Greyish over the ears	493095.5510669976
smiling	3162277660168.3784
I smiled back	25144245.169997267
A smile goes a long way	44186.087646907254
Only politeness perhaps	7765142.732286235
Nice fellow	868843352.9792744
Who knows is that true about the woman he keeps	3125.2605103074043
Not pleasant for the wife	165852.43770880112
Yet they say who was it told me there is no carnal	1435.7564585868508
You would imagine that would get played out pretty quick	1780.4073200613004
Yes it was Crofton met him one evening bringing her a pound of rumpsteak	625.1823700808758
What is this she was	110914.35324975195
Barmaid in Jury s	195899.5392225985
Or the Moira was it	79263.68636981268
They passed under the hugecloaked Liberator s form	4488.510149560734
Martin Cunningham nudged Mr Power	61185.77461678058
Of the tribe of Reuben he said	9071.62692847739
A tall blackbearded figure bent on a stick stumping round the corner of Elvery s Elephant house showed them a curved hand open on his spine	71.09709432312432
In all his pristine beauty Mr Power said	4751.130728800837
Mr Dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly The devil break the hasp of your back	225.77775386305763
Mr Power collapsing in laughter shaded his face from the window as the carriage passed Gray s statue	265.58887960476807
We have all been there Martin Cunningham said broadly	3096.978721755736
His eyes met Mr Bloom s eyes	16191.24689789857
Mr Bloom began to speak with sudden eagerness to his companions faces	959.3574931679374
That s an awfully good one that s going the rounds about Reuben J and the son	382.94506130054486
About the boatman	6676951.891781427
Mr Power asked	9920858.139356378
Yes	3162277660168.3784
Isn t it awfully good	71164.79880644419
What is that	9186684.05249403
Mr Dedalus asked	9701556.400784489
I didn t hear it	162082.56624889033
There was a girl in the case Mr Bloom began and he determined to send him to the Isle of Man out of harm s way but when they were both	36.51741272548377
What	3162277660168.3784
Mr Dedalus asked	9701556.400784489
That confirmed bloody hobbledehoy is it	20604.640529837012
Yes Mr Bloom said	445735.23450364324
They were both on the way to the boat and he tried to drown	1096.3639882853868
I wish to Christ he did	34946.1108487419
Mr Power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils	2052.107542580503
No Mr Bloom said the son himself	19948.074803146395
Martin Cunningham thwarted his speech rudely Reuben J and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on their way to the Isle of Man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got loose and over the wall with him into the Liffey	12.216773489967919
For God s sake	1113902.6558967102
Mr Dedalus exclaimed in fright	111023.62457436803
Is he dead	10497949.49513607
Dead	3162277660168.3784
Martin Cunningham cried	8823476.741070302
A boatman got a pole and fished him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father on the quay more dead than alive	41.011270705513006
Half the town was there	85326.0571739745
Yes Mr Bloom said	445735.23450364324
But the funny part is	106305.23198132566
And Reuben J Martin Cunningham said gave the boatman a florin for saving his son s life	235.4456627533301
A stifled sigh came from under Mr Power s hand	2297.9854159178612
O he did Martin Cunningham affirmed	57769.77539508328
Like a hero	9768096.118347399
A silver florin	17699200.23690044
Isn t it awfully good	71164.79880644419
Mr Bloom said eagerly	752726.9944569845
One and eightpence too much Mr Dedalus said drily	2811.644661213468
Mr Power s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage	1883.262814536021
Nelson s pillar	4622132.571781367
Eight plums a penny	284979.94679437927
Eight for a penny	553188.4540249769
We had better look a little serious Martin Cunningham said	1697.3301380823866
Mr Dedalus sighed	12766633.306129463
Ah then indeed he said poor little Paddy wouldn t grudge us a laugh	565.5735020867389
Many a good one he told himself	13866.163066129568
The Lord forgive me	936882.6749357155
Mr Power said wiping his wet eyes with his fingers	1776.807469910505
I little thought a week ago when I saw him last and he was in his usual health that I d be driving after him like this	61.05402296585327
He s gone from us	157145.42484629317
As decent a little man as ever wore a hat Mr Dedalus said	658.680058152421
He went very suddenly	966278.3284895975
Breakdown Martin Cunningham said	223727.48603238518
He tapped his chest sadly	160558.99344520996
Blazing face redhot	3510614.6324216095
Too much John Barleycorn	457642.3510873243
Cure for a red nose	112158.56302574801
Drink like the devil till it turns adelite	5890.896556031765
Mr Power gazed at the passing houses with rueful apprehension	1935.9145973857246
He had a sudden death poor fellow he said	3767.118597460866
The best death Mr Bloom said	31218.141870607415
Their wide open eyes looked at him	9010.843657704518
No suffering he said	677072.4880388144
A moment and all is over	73464.73860683225
Like dying in sleep	655906.4977987426
No one spoke	13920482.8013808
Dead side of the street this	52852.907214269
Dull business by day land agents temperance hotel Falconer s railway guide civil service college Gill s catholic club the industrious blind	52.84659803275931
Why	3162277660168.3784
Some reason	930195356.7777818
Sun or wind	4626686.967648145

White horses with white frontlet plumes came round the Rotunda corner galloping	522.8139433651231
A tiny coffin flashed by	107745.93587349288
In a hurry to bury	122463.51047985214

A child	1594161719.922658

If it s healthy it s from the mother	6625.997549318611
If not from the man	181910.13568466436
Better luck next time	464754.02143941855
Poor little thing Mr Dedalus said	21620.320460795974
It s well out of it	39910.8878803753
The carriage climbed more slowly the hill of Rutland square	1455.1884067518113
Rattle his bones	3516145.228320779
Over the stones	5718624.939983133
Only a pauper	8489998.312876979
Nobody owns	447262196.2410999
In the midst of life Martin Cunningham said	4377.772844177255
But the worst of all Mr Power said is the man who takes his own life	626.723406279221
Martin Cunningham drew out his watch briskly coughed and put it back	607.8629259915119
The greatest disgrace to have in the family Mr Power added	2534.874589012423
Temporary insanity of course Martin Cunningham said decisively	3876.7319780098583
We must take a charitable view of it	5515.069401568666
They say a man who does it is a coward Mr Dedalus said	963.9041548691928
It is not for us to judge Martin Cunningham said	2058.6517476739587
Mr Bloom about to speak closed his lips again	5254.639643647868
Martin Cunningham s large eyes	73729.41868695285
Looking away now	6646843.40676062
Sympathetic human man he is	56044.52005553884
Intelligent	3162277660168.3784
Like Shakespeare s face	774115.9936575878
Always a good word to say	32590.49144525122
They have no mercy on that here or infanticide	4407.576418253406
Refuse christian burial	3416694.292801719
They used to drive a stake of wood through his heart in the grave	665.415803091723
As if it wasn t broken already	12964.649145779871
Yet sometimes they repent too late	16491.816144028377
Found in the riverbed clutching rushes	26448.728951528254
He looked at me	948257.6633691201
And that awful drunkard of a wife of his	4275.906342236258
Setting up house for her time after time and then pawning the furniture on him every Saturday almost	204.34066377716368
Leading him the life of the damned	19040.257875333722

Start afresh	390722099.23233885
Shoulder to the wheel	701712.1413935793
Lord she must have looked a sight that night Dedalus told me he was in there	425.88114515325674
Drunk about the place and capering with Martin s umbrella	1299.907908778456
And they call me the jewel of Asia Of Asia The geisha	682.6436095288111
He looked away from me	197722.30821117107
He knows	1549735396.2370834
Rattle his bones	3516145.228320779
That afternoon of the inquest	339223.87055959646
The redlabelled bottle on the table	40994.789214216944
The room in the hotel with hunting pictures	9390.451072030728
Stuffy it was	3375726.8812203165
Sunlight through the slats of the Venetian blind	5694.956710002649

The carriage rattled swiftly along Blessington street	8153.3395065123
Over the stones	5718624.939983133
God grant he doesn t upset us on the road Mr Power said	639.7062256543045
That will be a great race tomorrow in Germany	3501.7536334222805
The Gordon Bennett	16931771.835946996
Yes by Jove Mr Dedalus said	23367.648025448314
That will be worth seeing faith	37454.443236329054
As they turned into Berkeley street a streetorgan near the Basin sent over and after them a rollicking rattling song of the halls	121.15276586285881

The carriage galloped round a corner stopped	14487.488499727431
What s wrong now	858133.0601257381
A divided drove of branded cattle passed the windows lowing slouching by on padded hoofs whisking their tails slowly on their clotted bony croups	68.10025382514873
Outside them and through them ran raddled sheep bleating their fear	698.6748567430984
Emigrants Mr Power said	237897.7691328836
Huuuh	3162277660168.3784

I can t make out why the corporation doesn t run a tramline from the parkgate to the quays Mr Bloom said	149.24955450518294
All those animals could be taken in trucks down to the boats	1024.7963451509468
Instead of blocking up the thoroughfare Martin Cunningham said	1556.9611037580414
Quite right	447262196.2410999
Yes Mr Bloom said and another thing I often thought is to have municipal funeral trams like they have in Milan you know	121.15276586285881
Run the line out to the cemetery gates and have special trams hearse and carriage and all	248.7769693195553
Don t you see what I mean	13078.355059056586
O that be damned for a story Mr Dedalus said	2669.8739327226535

A poor lookout for Corny Mr Power added	5334.777968823039
Why	3162277660168.3784
Mr Bloom asked turning to Mr Dedalus	12434.111460821445
Wouldn t it be more decent than galloping two abreast	1371.3546341143556
Well there s something in that Mr Dedalus granted	7305.956529782852
And Martin Cunningham said we wouldn t have scenes like that when the hearse capsized round Dunphy s and upset the coffin on to the road	71.09709432312432
That was terrible Mr Power s shocked face said and the corpse fell about the road	405.61925620488745
Terrible	3162277660168.3784

Was he insured	8719229.435331117
Mr Bloom asked	9378146.915657314
I believe so Mr Kernan answered	55580.22027341146

I often told poor Paddy he ought to mind that job	1427.168967619749
John Henry is not the worst in the world	4450.499015914214

Liquor what	310118385.0482162
Many a good man s fault Mr Dedalus said with a sigh	1280.8625563545968
They halted about the door of the mortuary chapel	5720.39031011915
Mr Bloom stood behind the boy with the wreath looking down at his sleekcombed hair and at the slender furrowed neck inside his brandnew collar	83.76776400682921
Poor boy	1086166761.5235136

Would he understand	7699627.875745181
The mutes bore the coffin into the chapel	7986.908964616614
Which end is his head	99459.38617495357
After a moment he followed the others in blinking in the screened light	866.1665896956023
The coffin lay on its bier before the chancel four tall yellow candles at its corners	282.513565004582
Always in front of us	96076.41765418723
Corny Kelleher laying a wreath at each fore corner beckoned to the boy to kneel	333.40238359824434
The mourners knelt here and there in prayingdesks	7176.608228814118
Mr Bloom stood behind near the font and when all had knelt dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it	61.05402296585327
He fitted his black hat gently on his left knee and holding its brim bent over piously	250.48604398364947
A server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a door	552.1639370889925

The priest took a stick with a knob at the end of it out of the boy s bucket and shook it over the coffin	83.76776400682921
Then he walked to the other end and shook it again	1891.6265067658737
Then he came back and put it back in the bucket	2260.3647497192906

Corny Kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in hoisted the coffin again carried it out and shoved it on their cart	121.15276586285881
Corny Kelleher gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother in law	478.46789557294323
All followed them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air	1249.2427865503346
Mr Bloom came last folding his paper again into his pocket	984.7384501965079
He gazed gravely at the ground till the coffincart wheeled off to the left	743.4162789847513
The metal wheels ground the gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres	71.09709432312432
The ree the ra the ree the ra the roo	1258.201540558168
Lord I mustn t lilt here	20702.419181392594
The O Connell circle Mr Dedalus said about him	4232.772358985122
Mr Power s soft eyes went up to the apex of the lofty cone	716.2175072128522
He s at rest he said in the middle of his people old Dan O	688.0587331700458
But his heart is buried in Rome	13162.461574052988
How many broken hearts are buried here Simon	3538.465359833947
Her grave is over there Jack Mr Dedalus said	2328.8151345938813
I ll soon be stretched beside her	12101.89232374251
Let Him take me whenever He likes	9044.499987590048
Breaking down he began to weep to himself quietly stumbling a little in his walk	368.1443045394278
Mr Power took his arm	152566.2690314863
She s better where she is he said kindly	5220.345733352112
I suppose so Mr Dedalus said with a weak gasp	3220.4923427555386
I suppose she is in heaven if there is a heaven	2620.7034929050433
Corny Kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to plod by	304.3889040410482
Sad occasions Mr Kernan began politely	20730.941544424168
Mr Bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head	1177.2774770524993
The others are putting on their hats Mr Kernan said	2223.596816253841
I suppose we can do so too	18373.89054804933
We are the last	745151.6399566748
This cemetery is a treacherous place	31454.531779638586
They covered their heads	705909.011876198
The reverend gentleman read the service too quickly don t you think	845.7188615454722
Mr Kernan said with reproof	161800.7052319072
Mr Bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot eyes	2363.344273383425
Secret eyes secretsearching	4622560.521846144
Mason I think not sure	77863.98660840772
Beside him again	5253278.409983352
We are the last	745151.6399566748
In the same boat	1226734.8420983762
Hope he ll say something else	28928.030961051285
Mr Kernan added The service of the Irish church used in Mount Jerome is simpler more impressive I must say	135.3864945451924
Mr Bloom gave prudent assent	116075.49674175006
The language of course was another thing	22794.350230682216
Mr Kernan said with solemnity am the resurrection and the	1641.9436475187267
That touches a man s inmost heart	13923.958041245452
It does Mr Bloom said	113622.95158076238
Your heart perhaps but what price the fellow in the six feet by two with his toes to the daisies	240.33404702474726
No touching that	13669942.349649169

One fine day it gets bunged up and there you are	1199.6352529929768
Lots of them lying around here lungs hearts livers	1639.1722753020142
Old rusty pumps damn the thing else	8415.936267102774
The resurrection and the life	279490.56634875387
Once you are dead you are dead	13313.993849713299

Corny Kelleher fell into step at their side	3928.0617209893585
Everything went off A he said	15910.705605641955
What	3162277660168.3784
He looked on them from his drawling eye	9619.334517989146
Policeman s shoulders	4967580.320433541
With your tooraloom tooraloom	559347.5156019607
As it should be Mr Kernan said	13099.169711236067
What	3162277660168.3784
Eh	3162277660168.3784
Corny Kelleher said	5215601.517600055
Mr Kernan assured him	755593.2077206846
Who is that chap behind with Tom Kernan	6088.999491397685
John Henry Menton asked	543605.5201206198
I know his face	1019235.0081764682
Ned Lambert glanced back	450745.39137685753
Bloom he said Madame Marion Tweedy that was is I mean the soprano	1217.9968832498594
She s his wife	1115693.2264783964
O to be sure John Henry Menton said	8146.426434018792
I haven t seen her for some time	8331.71576535538
She was a finelooking woman	163323.4774799019
I danced with her wait fifteen seventeen golden years ago at Mat Dillon s in Roundtown	327.9852165721454
And a good armful she was	40927.31654360921
He looked behind through the others	51007.48303320406
What is he	10347506.71448057
he asked	1388949569.5536497
What does he do	1055032.7235021968
Wasn t he in the stationery line	11796.425315676172
I fell foul of him one evening I remember at bowls	1821.8204548826561
Ned Lambert smiled	8060155.012296981
Yes he was he said in Wisdom Hely s	4387.553805012582
A traveller for blottingpaper	964048.5401232237
In God s name John Henry Menton said what did she marry a coon like that for	297.15975296158956
She had plenty of game in her then	7100.468339559062
Has still Ned Lambert said	63828.71848134529
He does some canvassing for ads	32979.198587103536
John Henry Menton s large eyes stared ahead	3856.6637849728195
The barrow turned into a side lane	19877.632801293865
A portly man ambushed among the grasses raised his hat in homage	818.413268564628
The gravediggers touched their caps	124983.87471281366
John O Connell Mr Power said pleased	12797.237362831871
He never forgets a friend	120716.34226054706
Mr O Connell shook all their hands in silence	4183.293528238121
Mr Dedalus said I am come to pay you another visit	1686.7101961777125
My dear Simon the caretaker answered in a low voice	1782.5695711178869
I don t want your custom at all	4908.93340522725
Saluting Ned Lambert and John Henry Menton he walked on at Martin Cunningham s side puzzling two long keys at his back	115.0545664201923
Did you hear that one he asked them about Mulcahy from the Coombe	888.5833595092053
I did not Martin Cunningham said	38107.65378117082
They bent their silk hats in concert and Hynes inclined his ear	559.0228782458971
The caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles	149.24955450518294
They tell the story he said that two drunks came out here one foggy evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs	83.76776400682921
They asked for Mulcahy from the Coombe and were told where he was buried	658.3268654802014
After traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough	950.355648381416
One of the drunks spelt out the name Terence Mulcahy	2641.406575972888
The other drunk was blinking up at a statue of Our Saviour the widow had got put up	222.96247957180844
The caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed	1962.9292458552063
He resumed And after blinking up at the sacred figure a bloody bit like the says he	370.0642691446909
s not says he done	308254.1645530878
Rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with Corny Kelleher accepting the dockets given him turning them over and scanning them as he walked	70.99426735608162
That s all done with a purpose Martin Cunningham explained to Hynes	1153.2443361331445
I know Hynes said	1028913.5501924447
I know that	14781612.382905155
To cheer a fellow up Martin Cunningham said	4250.516076325547
It s pure goodheartedness damn the thing else	4304.739335122351
Mr Bloom admired the caretaker s prosperous bulk	4329.389198975997
All want to be on good terms with him	3891.296474086929
Decent fellow John O Connell real good sort	3050.545026850605
Keys like Keyes s ad no fear of anyone getting out	699.5693964703843
No passout checks	10919515.017032212
	9.999999999999997e+19
I must see about that ad after the funeral	5644.05479439641
Did I write Ballsbridge on the envelope I took to cover when she disturbed me writing to Martha	216.17534071772795
Hope it s not chucked in the dead letter office	2522.491779854955
Be the better of a shave	54452.91118398571
Grey sprouting beard	4259051.687248758
That s the first sign when the hairs come out grey	1734.3691428266268
And temper getting cross	803067.0519141644
Silver threads among the grey	69427.02959840102
Fancy being his wife	385392.9902926484
Wonder he had the gumption to propose to any girl	1774.1733769701355
Come out and live in the graveyard	30314.692699591353
It might thrill her first	96976.79494354999
Courting death	310118385.0482162
Shades of night hovering here with all the dead stretched about	978.163836453064
The shadows of the tombs when churchyards yawn and Daniel O Connell must be a descendant I suppose who is this used to say he was a queer breedy man great catholic all the same like a big giant in the dark	14.547578108480476
Will o the wisp	561813.541533502

Well I have	10288693.349180242
It was a pitchdark night	122389.56032285129
The clock was on the stroke of twelve	8491.379380636658
Still they d kiss all right if properly keyed up	1619.5445866172684
Whores in Turkish graveyards	295946.08232182264

Eight children he has anyway	96045.35316729093
He has seen a fair share go under in his time lying around him field after field	282.6787502294192
Holy fields	781371915.4137927
More room if they buried them standing	9256.427417823013
Sitting or kneeling you couldn t	11891.291535412745
Standing	3162277660168.3784
His head might come up some day above ground in a landslip with his hand pointing	440.4409427742222
All honeycombed the ground must be oblong cells	5690.571080063409
And very neat he keeps it too trim grass and edgings	870.7040184129283
His garden Major Gamble calls Mount Jerome	6823.843068928611

Nothing to feed on feed on themselves	8325.970943438995
But they must breed a devil of a lot of maggots	1466.403904320327
Soil must be simply swirling with them	6698.683797115835
Your head it simply swurls	71358.99170194278
Those pretty little seaside gurls	75158.48804523576
He looks cheerful enough over it	27509.81696422933
Gives him a sense of power seeing all the others go under first	763.6425082595564
Wonder how he looks at life	32693.263178928086
Cracking his jokes too warms the cockles of his heart	916.4380667228519

Go out of mourning first	192767.08353771557
Hard to imagine his funeral	74752.88743756354
Seems a sort of a joke	34347.98372087629
Read your own obituary notice they say you live longer	1459.8122043977453
Gives you second wind	296865.63604167156
New lease of life	347733.77984396316

Two Corny Kelleher said	601843.074770473
Half ten and eleven	509423.8746303958
The caretaker put the papers in his pocket	9460.707957838522
The barrow had ceased to trundle	33502.886567820664
The mourners split and moved to each side of the hole stepping with care round the graves	359.7543766696437
The gravediggers bore the coffin and set its nose on the brink looping the bands round it	224.12215935211702

Always someone turns up you never dreamt of	3856.8422296581125
A fellow could live on his lonesome all his life	2257.1790087531062
Yes he could	12559239.813413918
Still he d have to get someone to sod him after he died though he could dig his own grave	235.76600533882132

Nice soft tweed Ned Lambert has in that suit	3108.186080605795
Tinge of purple	3516762.0355461016
I had one like that when we lived in Lombard street west	1199.9359346820827
Dressy fellow he was once	100276.15644597248
Used to change three suits in the day	4219.757005808373
Must get that grey suit of mine turned by Mesias	1584.631080260751
Hello	3162277660168.3784
It s dyed	14466587.86449672
His wife I forgot he s not married or his landlady ought to have picked out those threads for him	177.9045080852165
The coffin dived out of sight eased down by the men straddled on the gravetrestles	617.1042790373161
They struggled up and out and all uncovered	13626.981552791904
Twenty	3162277660168.3784
Pause	3162277660168.3784
If we were all suddenly somebody else	12653.218606928784
Far away a donkey brayed	73303.28470963282
Rain	3162277660168.3784
No such ass	13975582.787027482
Never see a dead one they say	12092.82548354836
Shame of death	4971026.585739746
Also poor papa went away	83555.60057674629
Gentle sweet air blew round the bared heads in a whisper	1089.917283802785
Whisper	3162277660168.3784
The boy by the gravehead held his wreath with both hands staring quietly in the black open space	297.64060698525833
Mr Bloom moved behind the portly kindly caretaker	5388.752774825637
Wellcut frockcoat	310118385.0482162
Weighing them up perhaps to see which will go next	1799.2095301171594
Well it is a long rest	70715.32821176643
Feel no more	6585486.48286494
It s the moment you feel	45407.313651556105
Must be damned unpleasant	698244.8032403149
Can t believe it at first	35800.132303960105
Mistake must be someone else	79536.24508454996
I haven t yet	1075594.0431771027
Then darkened deathchamber	11548399.746516246
Light they want	6230907.129505677
Whispering around you	4594481.568296317
Then rambling and wandering	595055.0228925358
Delirium all you hid all your life	5735.61670278447
The death struggle	20386408.259707563
His sleep is not natural	170521.0375113359
Press his lower eyelid	370521.21617315675
Watching is his nose pointed is his jaw sinking are the soles of his feet yellow	352.1877196791131
Pull the pillow away and finish it off on the floor since he s doomed	428.4051613816689
Devil in that picture of sinner s death showing him a woman	826.4300634782171
Dying to embrace her in his shirt	11216.666156437926
Last act of	6602608.411500608
Shall I nevermore behold	296907.1864321788
Bam	3162277660168.3784
He expires	3314384070.6963987
Gone at last	6657218.552807301
People talk about you a bit forget you	7213.34409629296
Don t forget to pray for him	10186.326556754095
Remember him in your prayers	205479.0066748575
Even Parnell	781371915.4137927
Ivy day dying out	236566.87727438734
Then they follow dropping into a hole one after the other	1402.845984139481
We are praying now for the repose of his soul	2346.7682510846407
Hoping you re well and not in hell	6434.415045416868
Nice change of air	659721.2827126756
Out of the fryingpan of life into the fire of purgatory	1955.7940127063318
Does he ever think of the hole waiting for himself	2346.1707346439007
They say you do when you shiver in the sun	2927.4432785752997
Someone walking over it	361846.9954812101
Callboy s warning	3516570.1004848476
Near you	729134299.302008
Mine over there towards Finglas the plot I bought	1519.4440821447236
Mamma poor mamma and little Rudy	18292.607567037554
The gravediggers took up their spades and flung heavy clods of clay in on the coffin	355.5880329234381
Mr Bloom turned away his face	32142.603177182933
And if he was alive all the time	9858.484826548158
Whew	3162277660168.3784
By jingo that would be awful	36478.50393881156
No no he is dead of course	20088.975227028557
Of course he is dead	137945.21864139993
Monday he died	7133902.618387442
They ought to have some law to pierce the heart and make sure or an electric clock or a telephone in the coffin and some kind of a canvas airhole	41.011270705513006
Flag of distress	3516947.0744909034
Three days	781371915.4137927
Rather long to keep them in summer	11909.571426727913
Just as well to get shut of them as soon as you are sure there s no	410.93907576207766
The clay fell softer	947811.6215122506
Begin to be forgotten	870976.140183098
Out of sight out of mind	43968.914973831495
The caretaker moved away a few paces and put on his hat	1103.1834086415483
Had enough of it	578499.5842927418
The mourners took heart of grace one by one covering themselves without show	529.2869092301788
Quietly sure of his ground he traversed the dismal fields	1267.7633979771852
Hynes jotting down something in his notebook	13955.740932333452
Ah the names	10131985.486821355
But he knows them all	130553.01959212647
No coming to me	1021925.8295938702
I am just taking the names Hynes said below his breath	1202.159487035824
What is your christian name	119920.08661587126
L Mr Bloom said	503752.7518493596
Leopold	3162277660168.3784
And you might put down M Coy s name too	2614.7995298834003
He asked me to	869314.2668289455
Charley Hynes said writing	505172.2096981886
I know	1103478878.038433
He was on the once	340982.41471543134
So he was before he got the job in the morgue under Louis Byrne	803.7502404936417
Good idea a postmortem for doctors	17576.328339969623
Find out what they imagine they know	7843.265327913422
He died of a Tuesday	377950.33054359787
Got the run	8156332.115679604
Levanted with the cash of a few ads	7871.474358752453
Charley you re my darling	94521.88479048171
That was why he asked me to	14871.171083117204
O well does no harm	112396.30615630448
I saw to that M Coy	44641.72456237597
Thanks old chap much obliged	75240.49527139537
Leave him under an obligation costs nothing	5475.869086850583
And tell us Hynes said do you know that fellow in the fellow was over there in the	373.6530455361258
Yes I saw him Mr Bloom said	13337.751677685173
Where is he now	677232.3854022635
M Intosh Hynes said scribbling	102386.92957799479
I don t know who he is	12551.771736406012
Is that his name	890896.5664174712
He moved away looking about him	33554.73565506267
No Mr Bloom began turning and stopping	12781.442200320555
I say Hynes	24986399.605720166
Didn t hear	6280550.855157965
What	3162277660168.3784
Where has he disappeared to	89299.41072068416
Not a sign	11350779.308196241

Kay ee double ell	231955.52129464695
Become invisible	310118385.0482162
Good Lord what became of him	24919.195970042474
A seventh gravedigger came beside Mr Bloom to take up an idle spade	596.4176647408458
O excuse me	14151818.487243691
He stepped aside nimbly	994142.8292336623
Clay brown damp began to be seen in the hole	2242.9773567036386
It rose	2076515553.3089883
Nearly over	447262196.2410999
A mound of damp clods rose more rose and the gravediggers rested their spades	389.5842878875301
All uncovered again for a few instants	17658.863654313285
The boy propped his wreath against a corner the brother in law his on a lump	360.116821347628
The gravediggers put on their caps and carried their earthy spades towards the barrow	541.7713711973022
Then knocked the blades lightly on the turf clean	3112.2687067059405
One bent to pluck from the haft a long tuft of grass	827.9347452592342
One leaving his mates walked slowly on with shouldered weapon its blade blueglancing	366.4120389322244
Silently at the gravehead another coiled the coffinband	3694.319247956705
His navelcord	1985985029.6726253
The brother in law turning away placed something in his free hand	1039.300718518103
Thanks in silence	7612935.728945502
Headshake	3162277660168.3784
I know that	14781612.382905155
For yourselves just	9920266.06036707
The mourners moved away slowly without aim by devious paths staying at whiles to read a name on a tomb	143.4411510651107
Let us go round by the chief s grave Hynes said	1186.5737370409142
We have time	12370772.176342318
Let us Mr Power said	79834.47749891075
They turned to the right following their slow thoughts	3874.93743588579
With awe Mr Power s blank voice spoke Some say he is not in that grave at all	279.35393616796426
That the coffin was filled with stones	12267.839552691441
That one day he will come again	17691.68885789836
Hynes shook his head	475407.8736024391
Parnell will never come again he said	10836.904817808858
He s there all that was mortal of him	5509.264220484032
Peace to his ashes	818622.6963769867
Mr Bloom walked unheeded along his grove by saddened angels crosses broken pillars family vaults stone hopes praying with upcast eyes old Ireland s hearts and hands	41.79060811201946
Pray for the repose of the soul of	7500.5774654563875
Does anybody really	5765791.156314648
Plant him and have done with him	10711.607767876203
Like down a coalshoot	816941.3494833227
Then lump them together to save time	11028.819529897568
All souls day	12615299.078267805
Twentyseventh I ll be at his grave	13842.02372286799
Ten shillings for the gardener	163215.65246548393
He keeps it free of weeds	37278.31082702457
Old man himself	9293876.432980508
Bent down double with his shears clipping	7499.46113414355
Who passed away	12204215.572304944
Who departed this life	619861.0771060182
As if they did it of their own accord	5303.269817754352
Got the shove all of them	20559.641394795177
Who kicked the bucket	607802.8868242644
More interesting if they told you what they were	3405.357111765106
So and So wheelwright	597423.4256233678
I travelled for cork lino	126720.13995868624
I paid five shillings in the pound	28396.78232523304
Or a woman s with her saucepan	21949.961232671012
Eulogy in a country churchyard it ought to be that poem of whose is it Wordsworth or Thomas Campbell	174.65682400443188
Entered into rest the protestants put it	4203.543559036215
Old Dr Murren s	478005.24816651933
The great physician called him home	38279.746399101234
Well it s God s acre for them	5959.467314044628
Nice country residence	7503704.279439154
Newly plastered and painted	225569.5695477098
Ideal spot to have a quiet smoke and read the Times Marriage ads they never try to beautify	169.71167318351704
Rusty wreaths hung on knobs garlands of bronzefoil	1857.7465885731385
Better value that for the money	42890.98371335615
Still the flowers are more poetical	30930.50859157146
The other gets rather tiresome never withering	9323.149783864012
Immortelles	3162277660168.3784
A bird sat tamely perched on a poplar branch	2965.0052327228836
Like stuffed	1213599434.4676678
Like the wedding present alderman Hooper gave us	3113.9772445756826
Hoo	3162277660168.3784
Not a budge out of him	25901.725739759328
Knows there are no catapults to let fly at him	1240.782627585457
Dead animal even sadder	397808.4534735294
Silly Milly burying the little dead bird in the kitchen matchbox a daisychain and bits of broken chainies on the grave	121.6051696075369
The Sacred Heart that is showing it	17600.082925203962
Heart on his sleeve	1027254.6032042479
Ought to be sideways and red it should be painted like a real heart	525.4068094097802
Ireland was dedicated to it or whatever that	5834.859737115506
Seems anything but pleased	481045.8655161807
Why this infliction	11474407.1957151
Would birds come then and peck like the boy with the basket of fruit but he said no because they ought to have been afraid of the boy	52.983169062837085
Apollo that was	4097741.5908627366
How many	739189927.3992728

As you are now so once were we	5609.537576480605
Besides how could you remember everybody	33032.364315562496
Eyes walk voice	6047261.741082472
Well the voice yes gramophone	137300.40611804498

Otherwise you couldn t remember the face after fifteen years say	934.337965498859
For instance who	10265250.661245178
A rattle of pebbles	910207.138509564
Wait	3162277660168.3784
Stop	3162277660168.3784
He looked down intently into a stone crypt	8016.068010074021
Some animal	930195356.7777818
Wait	3162277660168.3784
There he goes	8948574.592606483
An obese grey rat toddled along the side of the crypt moving the pebbles	446.67857602788956
An old stager greatgrandfather he knows the ropes	3923.9475975841547
The grey alive crushed itself in under the plinth wriggled itself in under it	427.51325572267194
Good hidingplace for treasure	469218.07294341136
Who lives there	12056276.51546853
Are laid the remains of Robert Emery	9475.010352735451
Robert Emmet was buried here by torchlight wasn t he	955.7105214363065
Tail gone now	3478417.501606628
One of those chaps would make short work of a fellow	1419.3788831654808
Pick the bones clean no matter who it was	1741.77441224609
Ordinary meat for them	235162.95951989962

Drowning they say is the pleasantest	37293.553921224666
See your whole life in a flash	17270.890346073753
But being brought back to life no	15543.082495823923
Can t bury in the air however	15326.861694548417
Out of a flying machine	158763.15973615373
Wonder does the news go about whenever a fresh one is let down	505.96557553822043
Underground communication	310118385.0482162
We learned that from them	134182.7111479974
Wouldn t be surprised	554921.340039981
Regular square feed for them	46488.23354700121
Flies come before he s well dead	12131.856359335132
Got wind of Dignam	629798.4756380981
They wouldn t care about the smell of it	4960.446170069091
Saltwhite crumbling mush of corpse smell taste like raw white turnips	388.0855346893016
The gates glimmered in front still open	11882.988762238027
Back to the world again	187805.5415672611
Enough of this place	650291.6773175091
Brings you a bit nearer every time	10649.202780906506

Poor papa too	8087685.525548054
The love that kills	1211600.0313400105
And even scraping up the earth at night with a lantern like that case I read of to get at fresh buried females or even putrefied with running gravesores	46.415888336127786
Give you the creeps after a bit	11872.556193385015
I will appear to you after death	21673.282076214517
You will see my ghost after death	10833.503952352543
My ghost will haunt you after death	7988.599485770645
There is another world after death named hell	5596.324841349397
I do not like that other world she wrote	4441.737317200365
No more do I	709708.179141292
Plenty to see and hear and feel yet	4468.059509577079
Feel live warm beings near you	15406.613398742293
Let them sleep in their maggoty beds	13991.070287459574

Like that Mr Bloom said crossing his forefingers at the top	1203.899628317827
Let him take that in first	42605.332636637504

Let him give us a three months renewal	5494.106241603234
A typesetter brought him a limp galleypage	17845.242317806194
He began to check it silently	38481.36535340825

O Molloy turned to Stephen and said quietly and slowly One of the most polished periods I think I ever listened to in my life fell from the lips of Seymour Bushe	32.74549162877729
It was in that case of fratricide the Childs murder case	1293.1582679586893

J	3162277660168.3784
O Molloy resumed moulding his words He said of it stony effigy in frozen music horned and terrible of the human form divine that eternal symbol of wisdom and of prophecy which if aught that the imagination or the hand of sculptor has wrought in marble of soultransfigured and of soultransfiguring deserves to live deserves to live His slim hand with a wave graced echo and fall	5.4361836201538365

No thanks professor MacHugh said waving the cigarettecase aside	2074.91734145998
Wait a moment	7400959.967555203
Let me say one thing	79190.81388088482
The finest display of oratory I ever heard was a speech made by John F Taylor at the college historical society	175.73397040156038
Mr Justice Fitzgibbon the present lord justice of appeal had spoken and the paper under debate was an essay new for those days advocating the revival of the Irish tongue	41.011270705513006
He turned towards Myles Crawford and said You know Gerald Fitzgibbon	1680.8108660823098
Then you can imagine the style of his discourse	4931.935570959748
J	3162277660168.3784
O Molloy said rumour has it on the Trinity college estates commission	911.0140592764152
He is sitting with a sweet thing Myles Crawford said in a child s frock	663.573537965758
Go on	465170276.8104911
Well	3162277660168.3784
It was the speech mark you the professor said of a finished orator full of courteous haughtiness and pouring in chastened diction I will not say the vials of his wrath but pouring the proud man s contumely upon the new movement	14.547578108480476
It was then a new movement	55614.57962271994
We were weak therefore worthless	88198.89707635134
He closed his long thin lips an instant but eager to be on raised an outspanned hand to his spectacles and with trembling thumb and ringfinger touching lightly the black rims steadied them to a new focus	20.691380811147894
IMPROMPTU In ferial tone he addressed J	4119.165820737528
J	3162277660168.3784
O Molloy Taylor had come there you must know from a sickbed	1082.2523637232384
That he had prepared his speech I do not believe for there was not even one shorthandwriter in the hall	240.40991835099712
His dark lean face had a growth of shaggy beard round it	676.7414620995938
He wore a loose white silk neckcloth and altogether he looked though he was not a dying man	242.21433818693927
His gaze turned at once but slowly from J	2822.9318932705255
J	3162277660168.3784
O Molloy s towards Stephen s face and then bent at once to the ground seeking	538.2506731880411
His unglazed linen collar appeared behind his bent head soiled by his withering hair	374.07925763886067
Still seeking he said When Fitzgibbon s speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply	260.4229817581374
Briefly as well as I can bring them to mind his words were these	528.8531749002193
He raised his head firmly	268153.3554946424
His eyes bethought themselves once more	20622.479349627043
Witless shellfish swam in the gross lenses to and fro seeking outlet	527.9204487547322
He began Mr Chairman ladies and gentlemen Great was my admiration in listening to the remarks addressed to the youth of Ireland a moment since by my learned friend	46.415888336127786
It seemed to me that I had been transported into a country far away from this country into an age remote from this age that I stood in ancient Egypt and that I was listening to the speech of some highpriest of that land addressed to the youthful Moses His listeners held their cigarettes poised to hear their smokes ascending in frail stalks that flowered with his speech	5.30441727984393
let our crooked smokes Noble words coming	6579.361175053119
Look out	868843352.9792744
Could you try your hand at it yourself	5942.654739818588
And it seemed to me that I heard the voice of that Egyptian highpriest raised in a tone of like haughtiness and like pride	100.00000000000001
I heard his words and their meaning was revealed to me FROM THE FATHERS It was revealed to me that those things are good which yet are corrupted which neither if they were supremely good nor unless they were good could be corrupted	13.68874509537081

Israel is weak and few are her children Egypt is an host and terrible are her arms	170.00196405537847
He lifted his voice above it boldly But ladies and gentlemen had the youthful Moses listened to and accepted that view of life had he bowed his head and bowed his will and bowed his spirit before that arrogant admonition he would never have brought the chosen people out of their house of bondage nor followed the pillar of the cloud by day	6.042963902381328
He would never have spoken with the Eternal amid lightnings on Sinai s mountaintop nor ever have come down with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the tables of the law graven in the language of the outlaw He ceased and looked at them enjoying a silence	8.11130830789687

O Molloy said not without regret And yet he died without having entered the land of promise	197.2174301974632
A sudden at the moment though from lingering illness often previously expectorated demise Lenehan added	305.47970070565714
And with a great future behind him	19955.300752176176
The troop of bare feet was heard rushing along the hallway and pattering up the staircase	253.09632459388803

Wants to cross	5490975.863959089
Do you want to cross	98961.88228408857
Mr Bloom asked	9378146.915657314
The blind stripling did not answer	48632.209708752314
His wallface frowned weakly	576423.7787212875
He moved his head uncertainly	264760.37516810186
You re in Dawson street Mr Bloom said	4623.418723158108

Do you want to cross	98961.88228408857
There s nothing in the way	40689.07790411034
The cane moved out trembling to the left	6573.188095598865
Mr Bloom s eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks van drawn up before Drago s	200.4881707942757

First turn to the left	146481.7191105112
The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way drawing his cane back feeling again	276.6944664372806
Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed	396.7845957369611
Poor young fellow	8919173.965023374
How on earth did he know that van was there	2177.8224984806775
Must have felt it	600600.2483353448
See things in their forehead perhaps kind of sense of volume	1541.3553191651529
Weight or size of it something blacker than the dark	1399.5711449739692
Wonder would he feel it if something was removed	3733.8345720032494
Feel a gap	6801884.999657245
Queer idea of Dublin he must have tapping his way round by the stones	637.7241926093053
Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn t that cane	1037.4829730062759
Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest	960.2938961606166
Penrose	3162277660168.3784

Look at all the things they can learn to do	2427.649231902643
Read with their fingers	731960.7221771264
Tune pianos	310118385.0482162
Or we are surprised they have any brains	7229.948771952134
Why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say	243.93349300977414
Of course the other senses are more	11773.636291679051

Then the spring the summer smells	33937.07300408325
Tastes	3162277660168.3784
They say you can t taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head	379.41647588611335
Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure	2311.680674967558
And with a woman for instance	72409.29017226821
More shameless not seeing	372440.8225372521
That girl passing the Stewart institution head in the air	1786.6930437988985
Look at me	8348660.255242267
I have them all on	244455.1208511799
Must be strange not to see her	12509.321018418908
Kind of a form in his mind s eye	4450.152556870599
The voice temperatures when he touches her with his fingers must almost see the lines the curves	344.0644521829113
His hands on her hair for instance	21278.87224279929
Say it was black for instance	38506.85676939362
Good	3162277660168.3784

Wait	3162277660168.3784
Think over it	5997643.87077651
With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his ears	268.5502593765623
Again	3162277660168.3784
Fibres of fine fine straw	48779.29481921528
Then gently his finger felt the skin of his right cheek	1935.6801142896152
Downy hair there too	271818.96383684245
Not smooth enough	10966021.199237872
The belly is the smoothest	299379.5628387845
No one about	11431101.532576941
There he goes into Frederick street	23786.571366703873
Perhaps to Levenston s dancing academy piano	5426.154806587925
Might be settling my braces	63426.343989786845
Walking by Doran s publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat and trousers and pulling aside his shirt gently felt a slack fold of his belly	61.05402296585327
But I know it s whitey yellow	19883.7674683272
Want to try in the dark to see	7657.414725973954
He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to	3738.596645053595
Poor fellow	1086166761.5235136
Terrible	3162277660168.3784

What is a ghost	1198136.868093683
Stephen said with tingling energy	124468.6683598167
One who has faded into impalpability through death through absence through change of manners	310.6484600795525
Elizabethan London lay as far from Stratford as corrupt Paris lies from virgin Dublin	226.5314201727761

A player comes on under the shadow made up in the castoff mail of a court buck a wellset man with a bass voice	100.00000000000001
It is the ghost the king a king and no king and the player is Shakespeare who has studied all the years of his life which were not vanity in order to play the part of the spectre	19.14481976169958
He speaks the words to Burbage the young player who stands before him beyond the rack of cerecloth calling him by a name Hamlet I am thy father s spirit bidding him list	29.552092352028872
To a son he speaks the son of his soul the prince young Hamlet and to the son of his body Hamnet Shakespeare who has died in Stratford that his namesake may live for ever	24.484367468222267
Is it possible that that player Shakespeare a ghost by absence and in the vesture of buried Denmark a ghost by death speaking his own words to his own son s name had Hamnet Shakespeare lived he would have been prince Hamlet s twin is it possible I want to know or probable that he did not draw or foresee the logical conclusion of those premises you are the dispossessed son I am the murdered father your mother is the guilty queen Ann Shakespeare born Hathaway	3.75588809068008

Her ghost at least has been laid for ever	2860.0705707353163
She died for literature at least before she was born	1993.0628520620503
She died Stephen retorted sixtyseven years after she was born	1739.7938686317598
She saw him into and out of the world	4864.690797004525
She took his first embraces	211311.73257355444

Bosh	3162277660168.3784
Stephen said rudely	15892501.30359474
A man of genius makes no mistakes	15315.939128829996
His errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery	1406.794002157475
Portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian softcreakfooted bald eared and assiduous	238.14327769235646
A shrew John Eglinton said shrewdly is not a useful portal of discovery one should imagine	269.489436725211
What useful discovery did Socrates learn from Xanthippe	3614.705620492248
Dialectic Stephen answered and from his mother how to bring thoughts into the world	582.1424904436121
What he learnt from his other wife Myrto nomen Socratididion s Epipsychidion no man not a woman will ever know	146.66905042911503
But neither the midwife s lore nor the caudlelectures saved him from the archons of Sinn Fein and their naggin of hemlock	92.97969093016626
But Ann Hathaway	13549578.551586885
Mr Best s quiet voice said forgetfully	10959.79952726542
Yes we seem to be forgetting her as Shakespeare himself forgot her	882.0821586504026
His look went from brooder s beard to carper s skull to remind to chide them not unkindly then to the baldpink lollard costard guiltless though maligned	44.6960016823748
He had a good groatsworth of wit Stephen said and no truant memory	856.7172856734026
He carried a memory in his wallet as he trudged to Romeville whistling girl I left behind me If the earthquake did not time it we should know where to place poor Wat sitting in his form the cry of hounds the studded bridle and her blue windows	10.481131341546856

Mr Best pleaded	15434332.396028992

Messer Brunetto I thank thee for the word	3241.046573968113
As we or mother Dana weave and unweave our bodies Stephen said from day to day their molecules shuttled to and fro so does the artist weave and unweave his image	36.51741272548377
And as the mole on my right breast is where it was when I was born though all my body has been woven of new stuff time after time so through the ghost of the unquiet father the image of the unliving son looks forth	12.216773489967919
So in the future the sister of the past I may see myself as I sit here now but by reflection from that which then I shall be	52.983169062837085
Drummond of Hawthornden helped you at that stile	2806.3136108389904
Yes Mr Best said youngly	133511.9248286215
I feel Hamlet quite young	139101.59299607296
The bitterness might be from the father but the passages with Ophelia are surely from the son	401.51857717150256

That mole is the last to go Stephen said laughing	4385.18779875708
If that were the birthmark of genius he said genius would be a drug in the market	383.5589826400922
The plays of Shakespeare s later years which Renan admired so much breathe another spirit	296.90304270613865

Such an appeal will touch him	15585.570814620503
The images of other males of his blood will repel him	1621.0746796568615
He will see in them grotesque attempts of nature to foretell or to repeat himself	367.7576731966688
The benign forehead of the quaker librarian enkindled rosily with hope	1171.9204113623462
I hope Mr Dedalus will work out his theory for the enlightenment of the public	676.444443798974
And we ought to mention another Irish commentator Mr George Bernard Shaw	676.6354788769872
Nor should we forget Mr Frank Harris	5272.4816518593725
His articles on Shakespeare in the were surely brilliant	3637.734040480493
Oddly enough he too draws for us an unhappy relation with the dark lady of the sonnets	301.7601337897606
The favoured rival is William Herbert earl of Pembroke	2090.122103271511
I own that if the poet must be rejected such a rejection would seem more in harmony with what shall I say our notions of what ought not to have been	36.51741272548377

That may be too Stephen said	42049.83597037069
There s a saying of Goethe s which Mr Magee likes to quote	450.4306198954485
Why does he send to one who is a a bay where all men ride a maid of honour with a scandalous girlhood a lordling to woo for him	46.415888336127786
He was himself a lord of language and had made himself a coistrel gentleman and he had written and	289.48052736284075
Why	3162277660168.3784
Belief in himself has been untimely killed	6361.1912128994145
He was overborne in a cornfield first ryefield I should say and he will never be a victor in his own eyes after nor play victoriously the game of laugh and lie down	29.552092352028872
Assumed dongiovannism will not save him	15803.784959224638

If the shrew is worsted yet there remains to her woman s invisible weapon	404.9379783491382
There is I feel in the words some goad of the flesh driving him into a new passion a darker shadow of the first darkening even his own understanding of himself	36.51741272548377

The poisoning and the beast with two backs that urged it King Hamlet s ghost could not know of were he not endowed with knowledge by his creator	52.983169062837085
That is why the speech his lean unlovely English is always turned elsewhere backward	319.6019577034404
Ravisher and ravished what he would but would not go with him from Lucrece s bluecircled ivory globes to Imogen s breast bare with its mole cinquespotted	59.44174216612955
He goes back weary of the creation he has piled up to hide him from himself an old dog licking an old sore	121.15276586285881
But because loss is his gain he passes on towards eternity in undiminished personality untaught by the wisdom he has written or by the laws he has revealed	52.983169062837085

He is a ghost a shadow now the wind by Elsinore s rocks or what you will the sea s voice a voice heard only in the heart of him who is the substance of his shadow the son consubstantial with the father	13.68874509537081

A most instructive discussion	805712.7712605967
Mr Mulligan I ll be bound has his theory too of the play and of Shakespeare	600.5928111156975
All sides of life should be represented	19612.754135216033
He smiled on all sides equally	49466.79394793586
Buck Mulligan thought puzzled Shakespeare	70471.84876832814

A onelegged sailor swinging himself onward by lazy jerks of his crutches growled some notes	271.71292182209163
He jerked short before the convent of the sisters of charity and held out a peaked cap for alms towards the very reverend John Conmee S	71.09709432312432
J	3162277660168.3784
Father Conmee blessed him in the sun for his purse held he knew one silver crown	368.98684902206395
Father Conmee crossed to Mountjoy square	20398.833947941897
He thought but not for long of soldiers and sailors whose legs had been shot off by cannonballs ending their days in some pauper ward and of cardinal Wolsey s words I had served my God as I have served my king He would not have abandoned me in my old days He walked by the treeshade of sunnywinking leaves and towards him came the wife of Mr David Sheehy M P	4.840960141478948
Very well indeed father	516663.8041875986
And you father	17141334.182267867
Father Conmee was wonderfully well indeed	18693.38403554727
And her boys were they getting on well at Belvedere	1812.4603267528944
Was that so	8665010.780692404
Father Conmee was very glad indeed to hear that	2410.4864956681336
And Mr Sheehy himself	807813.5517569683
Still in London	9977988.403694544
The house was still sitting to be sure it was	2441.5096766588636

Yes it was very probable that Father Bernard Vaughan would come again to preach	504.56179255252886
O yes a very great success	45431.78218327264
A wonderful man really	859083.9118304135
Father Conmee was very glad to see the wife of Mr David Sheehy M P	359.09281401896465
Iooking so well and he begged to be remembered to Mr David Sheehy M P	361.3866601014925
Yes he would certainly call	167735.00508470336
Good afternoon Mrs Sheehy	535212.0116906064
Father Conmee doffed his silk hat and smiled as he took leave at the jet beads of her mantilla inkshining in the sun	121.15276586285881
And smiled yet again in going	34832.121826913455
He had cleaned his teeth he knew with arecanut paste	1778.9680883833569
Father Conmee walked and walking smiled for he thought on Father Bernard Vaughan s droll eyes and cockney voice	143.34349063305393
Pilate	3162277660168.3784
Wy don t you old back that owlin mob	1919.6246849203042

And really did great good in his way	7203.25739716149
Beyond a doubt	4627408.798191254
He loved Ireland he said and he loved the Irish	3732.7751090778725
Of good family too would one think it	3579.7105341316355
Welsh were they not	503902.86075758864
O lest he forget	912575.7515875853
That letter to father provincial	118030.2430300887
Father Conmee stopped three little schoolboys at the corner of Mountjoy square	649.2168166183782
Yes they were from Belvedere	181583.71270768208
The little house	20360727.61004233
Aha	3162277660168.3784
And were they good boys at school	12416.580665747919
O	3162277660168.3784
That was very good now	187648.08839866566
And what was his name	175497.93324341386
Jack Sohan	1069073040.0400559
And his name	16729985.289452558
Ger	3162277660168.3784
Gallaher	3162277660168.3784
His name was Brunny Lynam	108271.90369063885
O that was a very nice name to have	5235.142401641253
Father Conmee gave a letter from his breast to Master Brunny Lynam and pointed to the red pillarbox at the corner of Fitzgibbon street	100.00000000000001
But mind you don t post yourself into the box little man he said	581.4017886835466
The boys sixeyed Father Conmee and laughed O sir	2965.220299373977
Well let me see if you can post a letter Father Conmee said	868.5043764915387
Master Brunny Lynam ran across the road and put Father Conmee s letter to father provincial into the mouth of the bright red letterbox	100.00000000000001
Father Conmee smiled and nodded and smiled and walked along Mountjoy square east	532.3940796690008
Mr Denis J Maginni professor of dancing c in silk hat slate frockcoat with silk facings white kerchief tie tight lavender trousers canary gloves and pointed patent boots walking with grave deportment most respectfully took the curbstone as he passed lady Maxwell at the corner of Dignam s court	10.0
Was that not Mrs M Guinness	20164.434860155237
Mrs M Guinness stately silverhaired bowed to Father Conmee from the farther footpath along which she sailed	236.59455379995245
And Father Conmee smiled and saluted	39581.37691900362
How did she do	778081.4431203495
A fine carriage she had	114000.18569970758
Like Mary queen of Scots something	23334.15432425306
And to think that she was a pawnbroker	12319.050632611155
Well now	903617087.1403139
Such a	530280962.0901607
what should he say	827898.1407423151
such a queenly mien	572992.1998608464
Father Conmee walked down Great Charles street and glanced at the shutup free church on his left	240.0356512615864
R	3162277660168.3784
Greene B A	5058265.958894848
will D V speak	797613.7814194763
The incumbent they called him	133898.9741197766
He felt it incumbent on him to say a few words	2138.9334569389216
But one should be charitable	173758.21783369986
Invincible ignorance	310118385.0482162
Father Conmee turned the corner and walked along the North Circular road	826.3856581787819
It was a wonder that there was not a tramline in such an important thoroughfare	515.9527138972935
Surely there ought to be	42123.96285836531
A band of satchelled schoolboys crossed from Richmond street	2012.363445568421
All raised untidy caps	604510.8359045809
Father Conmee greeted them more than once benignly	4381.463587257847
Christian brother boys	4151603.326736809
Father Conmee smelt incense on his right hand as he walked	1333.0103673053404
Saint Joseph s church Portland row	20034.808788422873
For aged and virtuous females	87482.21204456319
Father Conmee raised his hat to the Blessed Sacrament	4298.310944895945
Virtuous but occasionally they were also badtempered	6944.8318394061225
Near Aldborough house Father Conmee thought of that spendthrift nobleman	1345.4000132339972
And now it was an office or something	9136.763094885113
Father Conmee began to walk along the North Strand road and was saluted by Mr William Gallagher who stood in the doorway of his shop	83.76776400682921
Father Conmee saluted Mr William Gallagher and perceived the odours that came from baconflitches and ample cools of butter	97.9982259451531
He passed Grogan s the Tobacconist against which newsboards leaned and told of a dreadful catastrophe in New York	173.95390082274108
In America those things were continually happening	9443.570900158837
Unfortunate people to die like that unprepared	11424.309493171193
Still an act of perfect contrition	29077.450510743856
Father Conmee went by Daniel Bergin s publichouse against the window of which two unlabouring men lounged	233.24634138430628
They saluted him and were saluted	53051.911912139876
Father Conmee passed H	534192.6607109975
J	3162277660168.3784
O Neill s funeral establishment where Corny Kelleher totted figures in the daybook while he chewed a blade of hay	139.31447170353175
A constable on his beat saluted Father Conmee and Father Conmee saluted the constable	558.978212135464
In Youkstetter s the porkbutcher s Father Conmee observed pig s puddings white and black and red lie neatly curled in tubes	114.87834469618505
Moored under the trees of Charleville Mall Father Conmee saw a turfbarge a towhorse with pendent head a bargeman with a hat of dirty straw seated amidships smoking and staring at a branch of poplar above him	20.691380811147894
It was idyllic and Father Conmee reflected on the providence of the Creator who had made turf to be in bogs whence men might dig it out and bring it to town and hamlet to make fires in the houses of poor people	13.68874509537081
On Newcomen bridge the very reverend John Conmee S	2416.3557251991488
J	3162277660168.3784
of saint Francis Xavier s church upper Gardiner street stepped on to an outward bound tram	297.1405405839949
Off an inward bound tram stepped the reverend Nicholas Dudley C	698.4223170788637
C	3162277660168.3784
of saint Agatha s church north William street on to Newcomen bridge	903.1424520945478
At Newcomen bridge Father Conmee stepped into an outward bound tram for he disliked to traverse on foot the dingy way past Mud Island	76.26174026405178
Father Conmee sat in a corner of the tramcar a blue ticket tucked with care in the eye of one plump kid glove while four shillings a sixpence and five pennies chuted from his other plump glovepalm into his purse	16.57723885589317
Passing the ivy church he reflected that the ticket inspector usually made his visit when one had carelessly thrown away the ticket	83.50502331844014
The solemnity of the occupants of the car seemed to Father Conmee excessive for a journey so short and cheap	240.40991835099712
Father Conmee liked cheerful decorum	72912.39855448982
It was a peaceful day	145211.48538374444
The gentleman with the glasses opposite Father Conmee had finished explaining and looked down	554.0467563627706
His wife Father Conmee supposed	155033.72600259687
Father Conmee perceived her perfume in the car	6083.259135835711
He perceived also that the awkward man at the other side of her was sitting on the edge of the seat	187.38174228603845
Father Conmee at the altarrails placed the host with difficulty in the mouth of the awkward old man who had the shaky head	121.15276586285881
At Annesley bridge the tram halted and when it was about to go an old woman rose suddenly from her place to alight	121.15276586285881
The conductor pulled the bellstrap to stay the car for her	1036.780765092526
She passed out with her basket and a marketnet and Father Conmee saw the conductor help her and net and basket down and Father Conmee thought that as she had nearly passed the end of the penny fare she was one of those good souls who had always to be told twice you my child that they have been absolved for me But they had so many worries in life so many cares poor creatures	4.548777947003777
From the hoardings Mr Eugene Stratton grimaced with thick niggerlips at Father Conmee	258.4614482279091
Father Conmee thought of the souls of black and brown and yellow men and of his sermon on saint Peter Claver S	149.24955450518294
J	3162277660168.3784
and the African mission and of the propagation of the faith and of the millions of black and brown and yellow souls that had not received the baptism of water when their last hour came like a thief in the night	15.505157798326243
That book by the Belgian jesuit Nombre des Élus seemed to Father Conmee a reasonable plea	241.2338865021528
Those were millions of human souls created by God in His Own likeness to whom the faith had not D V been brought	106.0969370196703
But they were God s souls created by God	3511.492689887713
It seemed to Father Conmee a pity that they should all be lost a waste if one might say	190.6314057017155
At the Howth road stop Father Conmee alighted was saluted by the conductor and saluted in his turn	223.74321674803534
The Malahide road was quiet	125352.50831862974
It pleased Father Conmee road and name	13872.085736000581
The joybells were ringing in gay Malahide	9285.252167174182
Lord Talbot de Malahide immediate hereditary lord admiral of Malahide and the seas adjoining	343.0526009898213
Then came the call to arms and she was maid wife and widow in one day	422.3183076874764
Those were old worldish days loyal times in joyous townlands old times in the barony	278.8053062473769
Father Conmee walking thought of his little book Times in the and of the book that might be written about jesuit houses and of Mary Rochfort daughter of lord Molesworth first countess of Belvedere	26.826957952797255
A listless lady no more young walked alone the shore of lough Ennel Mary first countess of Belvedere listlessly walking in the evening not startled when an otter plunged	46.415888336127786
Who could know the truth	136863.22567556138
Not the jealous lord Belvedere and not her confessor if she had not committed adultery fully seminis inter vas naturale mulieris with her husband s brother	60.34862427961442
She would half confess if she had not all sinned as women did	637.8340505800279
Only God knew and she and he her husband s brother	1560.2969994209886
Father Conmee thought of that tyrannous incontinence needed however for man s race on earth and of the ways of God which were not our ways	71.09709432312432
Don John Conmee walked and moved in times of yore	1578.0018950951899
He was humane and honoured there	26973.900896215484
He bore in mind secrets confessed and he smiled at smiling noble faces in a beeswaxed drawingroom ceiled with full fruit clusters	106.12090159264937
And the hands of a bride and of a bridegroom noble to noble were impalmed by Don John Conmee	196.8671498538341
It was a charming day	161734.5242499619
The lychgate of a field showed Father Conmee breadths of cabbages curtseying to him with ample underleaves	287.3092264679338
The sky showed him a flock of small white clouds going slowly down the wind	384.43058266893496

A just and homely word	125750.6232919789
Father Conmee reading his office watched a flock of muttoning clouds over Rathcoffey	329.83134712138684
His thinsocked ankles were tickled by the stubble of Clongowes field	986.6621321022284
He walked there reading in the evening and heard the cries of the boys lines at their play young cries in the quiet evening	100.00000000000001

Father Conmee drew off his gloves and took his rededged breviary out	701.4096568454291

Father Conmee read in secret and and crossed his breast	1500.8477972938076
in adiutorium He walked calmly and read mutely the nones walking and reading till he came to in immaculati Principium verborum tuorum veritas in eternum omnia iudicia iustitiæ tuæ A flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a young woman with wild nodding daisies in her hand	8.11130830789687
Father Conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his breviary	655.9030244214426
Principes persecuti sunt me gratis et a verbis tuis formidavit cor meum Corny Kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner	32.74549162877729
He pulled himself erect went to it and spinning it on its axle viewed its shape and brass furnishings	195.79193089094318
Chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came to the doorway	297.79153786503554
There he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes and leaned against the doorcase looking idly out	178.31942941648003
Father John Conmee stepped into the Dollymount tram on Newcomen bridge	994.3475387983425

Corny Kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth while a generous white arm from a window in Eccles street flung forth a coin	61.05402296585327
What s the best news	166437.78365900813

A onelegged sailor crutched himself round MacConnell s corner skirting Rabaiotti s icecream car and jerked himself up Eccles street	91.06714059134826

Two barefoot urchins sucking long liquorice laces halted near him gaping at his stump with their yellowslobbered mouths	153.39260710088462
He swung himself forward in vigorous jerks halted lifted his head towards a window and bayed deeply and beauty The gay sweet chirping whistling within went on a bar or two ceased	32.74549162877729
The blind of the window was drawn aside	10668.17784575645

The horses he passed started nervously under their slack harness	1723.366127032301
He slapped a piebald haunch quivering near him and cried Woa sonny	744.310328018946

When you two begin	670088.8804800329
Nosey Flynn stooped towards the lever snuffling at it	1833.2089679174771
But how does it work here Tommy	12130.788594733416
he asked	1388949569.5536497
Tooraloo Lenehan said	3258294.7250339007

He s a hero he said simply	23994.584194688676
I know M Coy said	113340.5128073236
The drain you mean	800753.3050867784
Drain	3162277660168.3784
Lenehan said	523460529.8358388
It was down a manhole	179288.72511583447
They passed Dan Lowry s musichall where Marie Kendall charming soubrette smiled on them from a poster a dauby smile	117.9072989323666
Going down the path of Sycamore street beside the Empire musichall Lenehan showed M Coy how the whole thing was	135.4148683416315
One of those manholes like a bloody gaspipe and there was the poor devil stuck down in it half choked with sewer gas	121.15276586285881
Down went Tom Rochford anyhow booky s vest and all with the rope round him	345.8896576636319
And be damned but he got the rope round the poor devil and the two were hauled up	388.7847522313513
The act of a hero he said	21923.08575598257
At the Dolphin they halted to allow the ambulance car to gallop past them for Jervis street	147.30419316587904

While he waited in Temple bar M Coy dodged a banana peel with gentle pushes of his toe from the path to the gutter	100.00000000000001
The gates of the drive opened wide to give egress to the viceregal cavalcade	899.1711272009051

Through here	729134299.302008
They went up the steps and under Merchants arch	3920.1025290095595
A darkbacked figure scanned books on the hawker s cart	1579.8945847572595
There he is Lenehan said	114958.8848705938

I was with him one day and he bought a book from an old one in Liffey street for two bob	187.38174228603845
There were fine plates in it worth double the money the stars and the moon and comets with long tails	192.11923089547736

Come over in the sun	177219.96891846985

Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam came out of Mangan s late Fehrenbach s carrying a pound and a half of porksteaks	131.44529642255932

Lenehan said	523460529.8358388
A card reappeared on the windowsash of number Eccles street	1962.8800142297964
He checked his tale a moment but broke out in a wheezy laugh	784.3231351765639
Delahunt of Camden street had the catering and yours truly was chief bottlewasher	306.32963292019286
Bloom and the wife were there	68187.20677092703
Lashings of stuff we put up port wine and sherry and curacoa to which we did ample justice	128.37073176487718
Fast and furious it was	41410.12459988366
After liquids came solids	434191.9304958268
Cold joints galore and mince pies	11226.070216494285
I know M Coy said	113340.5128073236

Lenehan linked his arm warmly	123502.69563980082
But wait till I tell you he said	4923.491156244885
We had a midnight lunch too after all the jollification and when we sallied forth it was blue o clock the morning after the night before	71.09709432312432
Coming home it was a gorgeous winter s night on the Featherbed Mountain	677.3425061148887
Bloom and Chris Callinan were on one side of the car and I was with the wife on the other	240.40991835099712
We started singing glees and duets the early beam of	934.842021996337
She was well primed with a good load of Delahunt s port under her bellyband	352.784547278211
Every jolt the bloody car gave I had her bumping up against me	518.4166853233056
Hell s delights	5503593.255814126
She has a fine pair God bless her	6063.409405339019
Like that	545884694.9195335
He held his caved hands a cubit from him frowning I was tucking the rug under her and settling her boa all the time	93.69120076491473
Know what I mean	484270.615872664
His hands moulded ample curves of air	8961.500770585348
He shut his eyes tight in delight his body shrinking and blew a sweet chirp from his lips	222.65991404062473
The lad stood to attention anyhow he said with a sigh	2010.309286374086
She s a gamey mare and no mistake	6301.985226278639
Bloom was pointing out all the stars and the comets in the heavens to Chris Callinan and the jarvey the great bear and Hercules and the dragon and the whole jingbang lot	32.74549162877729
But by God I was lost so to speak in the milky way	1200.4671361010264
He knows them all faith	211927.464767822
At last she spotted a weeny weeshy one miles away	804.7837452596551
what star is that Poldy says she	14619.704485407665
one is it says Chris Callinan that s only what you might call a pinprick By God he wasn t far wide of the mark	83.76776400682921
Lenehan stopped and leaned on the riverwall panting with soft laughter	1182.8088803157689
I m weak he gasped	127302.45645376416
M Coy s white face smiled about it at instants and grew grave	532.2373150533275
Lenehan walked on again	817503.5650901763
He lifted his yachtingcap and scratched his hindhead rapidly	2003.8429979230546
He glanced sideways in the sunlight at M Coy	4494.941217850131
He s a cultured allroundman Bloom is he said seriously	2960.178695087793
He s not one of your common or garden	5249.708967711739
you know	924068338.694196
There s a touch of the artist about old Bloom	2518.646032581207
Mr Bloom turned over idly pages of Awful Disclosures of Maria then of Aristotle s Crooked botched print	125.90330599230336
Plates infants cuddled in a ball in bloodred wombs like livers of slaughtered cows	227.71877895482692

The shopman let two volumes fall on the counter	2997.3949452271404
Them are two good ones he said	5848.045160121202
Onions of his breath came across the counter out of his ruined mouth	911.5124580193404
He bent to make a bundle of the other books hugged them against his unbuttoned waistcoat and bore them off behind the dingy curtain	100.00000000000001
On O Connell bridge many persons observed the grave deportment and gay apparel of Mr Denis J Maginni professor of dancing c	84.89011289167907
Mr Bloom alone looked at the titles	19829.13276688276

The beautiful woman threw off her sabletrimmed wrap displaying her queenly shoulders and heaving embonpoint	257.43475145909036
An imperceptible smile played round her perfect lips as she turned to him calmly	529.1937810567102
Mr Bloom read again beautiful woman Warmth showered gently over him cowing his flesh	308.0463572634703

Phlegmy coughs shook the air of the bookshop bulging out the dingy curtains	594.5739976843416
The shopman s uncombed grey head came out and his unshaven reddened face coughing	459.34125574882466
He raked his throat rudely puked phlegm on the floor	1574.6228679982996
He put his boot on what he had spat wiping his sole along it and bent showing a rawskinned crown scantily haired	118.30571120344011
Mr Bloom beheld it	782317.0350134649

Mr Dedalus tugging a long moustache came round from Williams s row	640.8205378309729
He halted near his daughter	166967.93327798788
It s time for you she said	19636.412192443295

Give it up father Dilly said	30733.482379844212

He s going to say a word to long John to get him to take those two men off	316.227766016838
All I want is a little time	25285.009057213098
He looked with vague hope up and down the quay a big apple bulging in his neck	309.1031659667136
I know Mr Dedalus said nodding	46297.24305226543
Poor old bockedy Ben	414041.9998248075
He s always doing a good turn for someone	4275.527184465605
Hold hard	511982331.33206606
There he is by God he said arse and pockets	2803.463153250278
Ben Dollard s loose blue cutaway and square hat above large slops crossed the quay in full gait from the metal bridge	84.21292836047336
As he came near Mr Dedalus greeted Hold that fellow with the bad trousers	647.1577412724099
Hold him now Ben Dollard said	21076.953603177582
Mr Dedalus eyed with cold wandering scorn various points of Ben Dollard s figure	372.7257943252134
Then turning to Father Cowley with a nod he muttered sneeringly That s a pretty garment isn t it for a summer s day	100.00000000000001
Why God eternally curse your soul Ben Dollard growled furiously I threw out more clothes in my time than you ever saw	111.33762409379915
He stood beside them beaming on them first and on his roomy clothes from points of which Mr Dedalus flicked fluff saying They were made for a man in his health Ben anyhow	29.552092352028872
Bad luck to the jewman that made them Ben Dollard said	1162.2923061203078
Thanks be to God he s not paid yet	3619.7551549724676
Father Cowley asked	9974159.911291046
Cashel Boyle O Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell murmuring glassyeyed strode past the Kildare street club	143.25880397772622
Ben Dollard frowned and making suddenly a chanter s mouth gave forth a deep note	246.69551148723428
Aw	3162277660168.3784
he said	702914306.569534
That s the style Mr Dedalus said nodding to its drone	1345.101093864522
What about that	10929242.402744612
Ben Dollard said	5097523.171763707
Not too dusty	11389348.54054069
What	3162277660168.3784
He turned to both	1046415.1949872295
That ll do Father Cowley said nodding also	5868.443922955935
The reverend Hugh C	705526.9716057499
Love walked from the old chapterhouse of saint Mary s abbey past James and Charles Kennedy s rectifiers attended by Geraldines tall and personable towards the Tholsel beyond the ford of hurdles	32.74549162877729
Ben Dollard with a heavy list towards the shopfronts led them forward his joyful fingers in the air	186.54867124351188
Come along with me to the subsheriff s office he said	1586.2109458293182
I want to show you the new beauty Rock has for a bailiff	1087.1021393310753
He s a cross between Lobengula and Lynchehaun	4728.777693231726
He s well worth seeing mind you	13493.942604469063
Come along	731794706.2784623
I saw John Henry Menton casually in the Bodega just now and it will cost me a fall if I don t	149.24955450518294
Wait awhile	841685138.4669398
We re on the right lay Bob believe you me	2152.663241752745
For a few days tell him Father Cowley said anxiously	2298.7022190968332
Ben Dollard halted and stared his loud orifice open a dangling button of his coat wagging brightbacked from its thread as he wiped away the heavy shraums that clogged his eyes to hear aright	26.826957952797255
What few days	15957529.133878788
he boomed	4373541842.256975
Hasn t your landlord distrained for rent	4422.041034687456
He has Father Cowley said	129389.94975058563
Then our friend s writ is not worth the paper it s printed on Ben Dollard said	311.63164222400525
The landlord has the prior claim	35106.46216991063
I gave him all the particulars	74726.45505809823
Windsor avenue	310118385.0482162
That s right Father Cowley said	28149.354562937035
The reverend Mr Love	1052525.746160764
He s a minister in the country somewhere	11217.991183630123
But are you sure of that	48682.4827842209
You can tell Barabbas from me Ben Dollard said that he can put that writ where Jacko put the nuts	183.37365064005837
He led Father Cowley boldly forward linked to his bulk	2482.684804441417
Filberts I believe they were Mr Dedalus said as he dropped his glasses on his coatfront following them	242.186435155392
The youngster will be all right Martin Cunningham said as they passed out of the Castleyard gate	434.8868101171488
The policeman touched his forehead	152357.70111499348
God bless you Martin Cunningham said cheerily	10490.595923049259
He signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on towards Lord Edward street	294.36331752727807
Bronze by gold Miss Kennedy s head by Miss Douce s head appeared above the crossblind of the Ormond hotel	163.3197793300706
Yes Martin Cunningham said fingering his beard	10357.786521938606
I wrote to Father Conmee and laid the whole case before him	1215.7102652596764
You could try our friend Mr Power suggested backward	3292.6457293799085
Boyd	3162277660168.3784
Martin Cunningham said shortly	490054.5494900133
Touch me not	6069188.424088554
John Wyse Nolan lagging behind reading the list came after them quickly down Cork hill	238.3041946969666
On the steps of the City hall Councillor Nannetti descending hailed Alderman Cowley and Councillor Abraham Lyon ascending	143.62477907520312
The castle car wheeled empty into upper Exchange street	2168.7706644352515
Look here Martin John Wyse Nolan said overtaking them at the office	676.1945654492515
I see Bloom put his name down for five shillings	2558.459085890862
Quite right Martin Cunningham said taking the list	4617.8495482887265
And put down the five shillings too	23479.34773308717
Without a second word either Mr Power said	3122.07016192238
Strange but true Martin Cunningham added	18931.500760124967
John Wyse Nolan opened wide eyes	19072.550345472075
I ll say there is much kindness in the jew he quoted elegantly	904.6016216563712
They went down Parliament street	124437.47210670658
There s Jimmy Henry Mr Power said just heading for Kavanagh s	562.8818214525177
Righto Martin Cunningham said	242625.18104442605
Here goes	1018993271.8443443
Outside Maison Blazes Boylan waylaid Jack Mooney s brother in law humpy tight making for the liberties	188.5083575668132
John Wyse Nolan fell back with Mr Power while Martin Cunningham took the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit who walked uncertainly with hasty steps past Micky Anderson s watches	22.456979955397745
The assistant town clerk s corns are giving him some trouble John Wyse Nolan told Mr Power	166.18893621833436
They followed round the corner towards James Kavanagh s winerooms	1724.3243255877921
The empty castle car fronted them at rest in Essex gate	1028.3036223719241
Martin Cunningham speaking always showed often the list at which Jimmy Henry did not glance	273.3009240498608
And long John Fanning is here too John Wyse Nolan said as large as life	354.70976281550986
The tall form of long John Fanning filled the doorway where he stood	796.810647794937
Good day Mr Subsheriff Martin Cunningham said as all halted and greeted	785.683605269436
Long John Fanning made no way for them	3333.672397944795
Are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations	2467.217753000919
he said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk	1343.6796906402135
Hell open to christians they were having Jimmy Henry said pettishly about their damned Irish language	182.8942812027895
Where was the marshal he wanted to know to keep order in the council chamber	601.8207578685497
And old Barlow the macebearer laid up with asthma no mace on the table nothing in order no quorum even and Hutchinson the lord mayor in Llandudno and little Lorcan Sherlock doing for him	26.826957952797255
Damned Irish language language of our forefathers	11181.335205941481
Long John Fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips	837.3960715361108
Martin Cunningham spoke by turns twirling the peak of his beard to the assistant town clerk and the subsheriff while John Wyse Nolan held his peace	71.09709432312432
What Dignam was that	801786.8323489823
long John Fanning asked	627608.7906194454
Jimmy Henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot	1701.6842965224844
O my corns	16947218.254944872
he said plaintively	23993349.375869423
Come upstairs for goodness sake till I sit down somewhere	1485.3361807258673
Uff	3162277660168.3784
Ooo	3162277660168.3784
Mind	3162277660168.3784
Testily he made room for himself beside long John Fanning s flank and passed in and up the stairs	176.4702604400411
Come on up Martin Cunningham said to the subsheriff	3981.471304634567
I don t think you knew him or perhaps you did though	1184.4905899104654
With John Wyse Nolan Mr Power followed them in	3032.7316722564415
Decent little soul he was Mr Power said to the stalwart back of long John Fanning ascending towards long John Fanning in the mirror	100.00000000000001
Rather lowsized	620208081.1368749
Dignam of Menton s office that was Martin Cunningham said	1765.8093280589915
Long John Fanning could not remember him	8636.079611516072
Clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air	5501.095689761531
What s that	8568323.4942259
Martin Cunningham said	3628207.431948345
All turned where they stood	133655.88886414646
John Wyse Nolan came down again	24024.501931292325
From the cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass Parliament street harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering	132.3514581778724
Gaily they went past before his cool unfriendly eyes not quickly	641.738537831454
In saddles of the leaders leaping leaders rode outriders	3481.507037244937
What was it	11648335.725815358
Martin Cunningham asked as they went on up the staircase	2255.0039144537564
The lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of Ireland John Wyse Nolan answered from the stairfoot	385.5453412408723
As they trod across the thick carpet Buck Mulligan whispered behind his Panama to Haines Parnell s brother	184.88752489813794
There in the corner	1539079.4262090877
They chose a small table near the window opposite a longfaced man whose beard and gaze hung intently down on a chessboard	115.12495481135707
Is that he	7829455.121630267
Haines asked twisting round in his seat	13722.70708713995
Yes Mulligan said	12300372.84825249
That s John Howard his brother our city marshal	2751.5617852194227
John Howard Parnell translated a white bishop quietly and his grey claw went up again to his forehead whereat it rested	141.94177185669508
An instant after under its screen his eyes looked quickly ghostbright at his foe and fell once more upon a working corner	108.86164709304538
I ll take a Haines said to the waitress	6110.977061385578
Two Buck Mulligan said	501164.47086182865
And bring us some scones and butter and some cakes as well	793.8945728599733
When she had gone he said laughing We call it D B C	828.6113679360603
because they have damn bad cakes	34450.21843976838
O but you missed Dedalus on Haines opened his newbought book	905.3668921888623
I m sorry he said	127376.55447668668
Shakespeare is the happy huntingground of all minds that have lost their balance	737.5717186140843
Buck Mulligan s primrose waistcoat shook gaily to his laughter	1470.8437246725402
You should see him he said when his body loses its balance	1335.6727165063587
Wandering Ængus I call him	46691.44193336123
I am sure he has an fixe Haines said pinching his chin thoughtfully with thumb and forefinger	251.4200074561284
Now I am speculating what it would be likely to be	1353.7217009744916
Such persons always have	359070.37630061776
Buck Mulligan bent across the table gravely	13425.164701556481
They drove his wits astray he said by visions of hell	1147.1068254278944
He will never capture the Attic note	9669.080394523127
The note of Swinburne of all poets the white death and the ruddy birth	626.8115520200055
That is his tragedy	1102347.7505597263
He can never be a poet	61384.98934826411
The joy of creation	1054296.0980249813
Eternal punishment Haines said nodding curtly	19521.017757775
I see	1282689994.4084778
I tackled him this morning on belief	15461.588426769404
There was something on his mind I saw	9058.938087833734
It s rather interesting because professor Pokorny of Vienna makes an interesting point out of that	227.39781734751742
Buck Mulligan s watchful eyes saw the waitress come	2092.993397915098
He helped her to unload her tray	13618.625264750592
He can find no trace of hell in ancient Irish myth Haines said amid the cheerful cups	236.15670525962557
Rather strange he should have just that fixed idea	2344.210025794754
Does he write anything for your movement	9011.748083724771
He sank two lumps of sugar deftly longwise through the whipped cream	765.19103724643
Buck Mulligan slit a steaming scone in two and plastered butter over its smoking pith	213.9736109418976
He bit off a soft piece hungrily	21241.10764596324
Ten years he said chewing and laughing	14139.915097317762
He is going to write something in ten years	4047.714184443744
Seems a long way off Haines said thoughtfully lifting his spoon	1035.355584185712
He tasted a spoonful from the creamy cone of his cup	1905.3406256743988
This is real Irish cream I take it he said with forbearance	916.6183458705048
I don t want to be imposed on	7176.939583748965
Elijah skiff light crumpled throwaway sailed eastward by flanks of ships and trawlers amid an archipelago of corks beyond new Wapping street past Benson s ferry and by the threemasted schooner from Bridgwater with bricks	23.43141647412208
Almidano Artifoni walked past Holles street past Sewell s yard	884.01684982814
Behind him Cashel Boyle O Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell with stickumbrelladustcoat dangling shunned the lamp before Mr Law Smith s house and crossing walked along Merrion square	40.67184679683592
Distantly behind him a blind stripling tapped his way by the wall of College park	432.0674284475187
Cashel Boyle O Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell walked as far as Mr Lewis Werner s cheerful windows then turned and strode back along Merrion square his stickumbrelladustcoat dangling	35.90517247029166
His eyeglass flashed frowning in the sun	12097.489941592368
With ratsteeth bared he muttered volui He strode on for Clare street grinding his fierce word	171.31191525806892
As he strode past Mr Bloom s dental windows the sway of his dustcoat brushed rudely from its angle a slender tapping cane and swept onwards having buffeted a thewless body	36.51741272548377
The blind stripling turned his sickly face after the striding form	1185.8122851861372
God s curse on you he said sourly whoever you are	1300.6705934507304
Opposite Ruggy O Donohoe s Master Patrick Aloysius Dignam pawing the pound and a half of Mangan s late Fehrenbach s porksteaks he had been sent for went along warm Wicklow street dawdling	29.552092352028872
It was too blooming dull sitting in the parlour with Mrs Stoer and Mrs Quigley and Mrs MacDowell and the blind down and they all at their sniffles and sipping sups of the superior tawny sherry uncle Barney brought from Tunney s	14.547578108480476
And they eating crumbs of the cottage fruitcake jawing the whole blooming time and sighing	381.4634345324254
After Wicklow lane the window of Madame Doyle courtdress milliner stopped him	480.6207580167627
He stood looking in at the two puckers stripped to their pelts and putting up their props	332.30866115909646
From the sidemirrors two mourning Masters Dignam gaped silently	1249.49654588976
Myler Keogh Dublin s pet lamb will meet sergeantmajor Bennett the Portobello bruiser for a purse of fifty sovereigns	102.5779585612897
Gob that d be a good pucking match to see	1830.2819746051757
Myler Keogh that s the chap sparring out to him with the green sash	768.9817222570488
Two bar entrance soldiers half price	18582.842225870358
I could easy do a bunk on ma	5823.55321507369
Master Dignam on his left turned as he turned	4466.359570579964
That s me in mourning	176096.3929038736
When is it	9419382.520471659
May the twentysecond	8428484.59312983
Sure the blooming thing is all over	7648.397439065118
He turned to the right and on his right Master Dignam turned his cap awry his collar sticking up	288.7325811652916
Buttoning it down his chin lifted he saw the image of Marie Kendall charming soubrette beside the two puckers	161.31045913484311
One of them mots that do be in the packets of fags Stoer smokes that his old fellow welted hell out of him for one time he found out	46.415888336127786
Master Dignam got his collar down and dawdled on	2607.4065363646
The best pucker going for strength was Fitzsimons	4759.685380100501
One puck in the wind from that fellow would knock you into the middle of next week man	290.1626493019555
But the best pucker for science was Jem Corbet before Fitzsimons knocked the stuffings out of him dodging and all	108.63539071813567
In Grafton street Master Dignam saw a red flower in a toff s mouth and a swell pair of kicks on him and he listening to what the drunk was telling him and grinning all the time	20.691380811147894
No Sandymount tram	13622955.180528086
Master Dignam walked along Nassau street shifted the porksteaks to his other hand	475.78023890099564
His collar sprang up again and he tugged it down	2246.2489310764563
The blooming stud was too small for the buttonhole of the shirt blooming end to it	451.6292468034935
He met schoolboys with satchels	125206.30077366588
He met other schoolboys	980922.3079797683
Do they notice I m in mourning	12307.226881246625
Uncle Barney said he d get it into the paper tonight	1592.739151827381
Then they ll all see it in the paper and read my name printed and pa s name	273.28907797777634
His face got all grey instead of being red like it was and there was a fly walking over it up to his eye	100.00000000000001
The scrunch that was when they were screwing the screws into the coffin and the bumps when they were bringing it downstairs	149.24955450518294
Pa was inside it and ma crying in the parlour and uncle Barney telling the men how to get it round the bend	121.15276586285881
A big coffin it was and high and heavylooking	4631.920394429745
How was that	12013006.221712459
The last night pa was boosed he was standing on the landing there bawling out for his boots to go out to Tunney s for to boose more and he looked butty and short in his shirt	20.691380811147894
Never see him again	735661.1904412808
Death that is	5206700.795272074
Pa is dead	4615784.359586898
My father is dead	700466.7657236871
He told me to be a good son to ma	3331.8294673746877
I couldn t hear the other things he said but I saw his tongue and his teeth trying to say it better	149.24955450518294
Poor pa	1086166761.5235136
That was Mr Dignam my father	35836.37802622897
William Humble earl of Dudley and lady Dudley accompanied by lieutenantcolonel Heseltine drove out after luncheon from the viceregal lodge	102.78425447627943

The cavalcade passed out by the lower gate of Phoenix park saluted by obsequious policemen and proceeded past Kingsbridge along the northern quays	111.08778439803156
The viceroy was most cordially greeted on his way through the metropolis	1145.7773209671993
At Bloody bridge Mr Thomas Kernan beyond the river greeted him vainly from afar	313.82695402783196
Between Queen s and Whitworth bridges lord Dudley s viceregal carriages passed and were unsaluted by Mr Dudley White B	100.64532593768159

A couched spear of acuminated granite rested by him while at his feet reposed a savage animal of the canine tribe whose stertorous gasps announced that he was sunk in uneasy slumber a supposition confirmed by hoarse growls and spasmodic movements which his master repressed from time to time by tranquilising blows of a mighty cudgel rudely fashioned out of paleolithic stone	6.218001087320917

Begob he was what you might call flabbergasted	7064.41251571135
Communication was effected through the pituitary body and also by means of the orangefiery and scarlet rays emanating from the sacral region and solar plexus	75.46903691868548
Questioned by his earthname as to his whereabouts in the heavenworld he stated that he was now on the path of prālāyā or return but was still submitted to trial at the hands of certain bloodthirsty entities on the lower astral levels	14.547578108480476
In reply to a question as to his first sensations in the great divide beyond he stated that previously he had seen as in a glass darkly but that those who had passed over had summit possibilities of atmic development opened up to them	12.91549665014884
Interrogated as to whether life there resembled our experience in the flesh he stated that he had heard from more favoured beings now in the spirit that their abodes were equipped with every modern home comfort such as tālāfānā ālāvātār hātākāldā wātāklāsāt and that the highest adepts were steeped in waves of volupcy of the very purest nature	7.038135554931555
Having requested a quart of buttermilk this was brought and evidently afforded relief	291.5019314446064
Asked if he had any message for the living he exhorted all who were still at the wrong side of Māyā to acknowledge the true path for it was reported in devanic circles that Mars and Jupiter were out for mischief on the eastern angle where the ram has power	9.55855309468529
It was then queried whether there were any special desires on the part of the defunct and the reply was greet you friends of earth who are still in the body	36.51741272548377
Mind C	689651541.8199954

Assurances were given that the matter would be attended to and it was intimated that this had given satisfaction	235.01986807408522
He is gone from mortal haunts O Dignam sun of our morning	806.2706643568268
Fleet was his foot on the bracken Patrick of the beamy brow	1047.5795201839867

Bloom says he	12925440.957901295
He s on point duty up and down there for the last ten minutes	736.5150532935826
And begob I saw his physog do a peep in and then slidder off again	437.2573838794587

I beg your parsnips says Alf	27836.555457605056
Is that a good Christ says Bob Doran to take away poor little Willy Dignam	386.6037115391402
Ah well says Alf trying to pass it off	3486.6959189871027
He s over all his troubles	73539.70934364919
But Bob Doran shouts out of him	12149.074933860542
He s a bloody ruffian I say to take away poor little Willy Dignam	588.9088619456041
Terry came down and tipped him the wink to keep quiet that they didn t want that kind of talk in a respectable licensed premises	83.76776400682921
And Bob Doran starts doing the weeps about Paddy Dignam true as you re there	390.14457968037726
The finest man says he snivelling the finest purest character	1981.9742858868249
The tear is bloody near your eye	10071.807457182675
Talking through his bloody hat	97450.8436404822
Fitter for him go home to the little sleepwalking bitch he married Mooney the bumbailiff s daughter mother kept a kip in Hardwicke street that used to be stravaging about the landings Bantam Lyons told me that was stopping there at two in the morning without a stitch on her exposing her person open to all comers fair field and no favour	6.218001087320917
The noblest the truest says he	26103.07401998812
And he s gone poor little Willy poor little Paddy Dignam	1364.6071649801254
And mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that beam of heaven	340.925360652331
Old Garryowen started growling again at Bloom that was skeezing round the door	658.9865554054942
Come in come on he won t eat you says the citizen	805.1512884660633
So Bloom slopes in with his cod s eye on the dog and he asks Terry was Martin Cunningham there	209.3876610450453
O Christ M Keown says Joe reading one of the letters	1564.2010381545574
Listen to this will you	100308.6932598543
And he starts reading out one	29587.436725330157
Hunter Street Liverpool the High Sheriff of Dublin Dublin sir i beg to offer my services in the abovementioned painful case i hanged Joe Gann in Bootle jail on the of Febuary and i hanged Show us Joe says I	16.57723885589317

Rumbold Master Barber And a barbarous bloody barbarian he is too says the citizen	290.8502494283568
And the dirty scrawl of the wretch says Joe	4429.850569580703
Here says he take them to hell out of my sight Alf	1728.6815818141831
Hello Bloom says he what will you have	6196.495471907623
So they started arguing about the point Bloom saying he wouldn t and he couldn t and excuse him no offence and all to that and then he said well he d just take a cigar	22.456979955397745
Gob he s a prudent member and no mistake	3118.532566111877
Give us one of your prime stinkers Terry says Joe	1479.1639445813928
And Alf was telling us there was one chap sent in a mourning card with a black border round it	234.52651026007828
They re all barbers says he from the black country that would hang their own fathers for five quid down and travelling expenses	121.15276586285881
And he was telling us there s two fellows waiting below to pull his heels down when he gets the drop and choke him properly and then they chop up the rope after and sell the bits for a few bob a skull	13.68874509537081
In the dark land they bide the vengeful knights of the razor	823.2624922925625
Their deadly coil they grasp yea and therein they lead to Erebus whatsoever wight hath done a deed of blood for I will on nowise suffer it even so saith the Lord	32.74549162877729
So they started talking about capital punishment and of course Bloom comes out with the why and the wherefore and all the codology of the business and the old dog smelling him all the time I m told those jewies does have a sort of a queer odour coming off them for dogs about I don t know what all deterrent effect and so forth and so on	5.30441727984393
There s one thing it hasn t a deterrent effect on says Alf	509.20910591714244
What s that	8568323.4942259
says Joe	547981446.2614847
The poor bugger s tool that s being hanged says Alf	1107.9985224041927
That so	1320104576.1557424
says Joe	547981446.2614847
God s truth says Alf	99868.97325281533
I heard that from the head warder that was in Kilmainham when they hanged Joe Brady the invincible	327.30570731533123
He told me when they cut him down after the drop it was standing up in their faces like a poker	187.38174228603845
Ruling passion strong in death says Joe as someone said	1173.577617973157
That can be explained by science says Bloom	5354.927554506617
It s only a natural phenomenon don t you see because on account of the	369.39331893059517
And then he starts with his jawbreakers about phenomenon and science and this phenomenon and the other phenomenon	303.70544117647654
The distinguished scientist Herr Professor Luitpold Blumenduft tendered medical evidence to the effect that the instantaneous fracture of the cervical vertebrae and consequent scission of the spinal cord would according to the best approved tradition of medical science be calculated to inevitably produce in the human subject a violent ganglionic stimulus of the nerve centres of the genital apparatus thereby causing the elastic pores of the to rapidly dilate in such a way as to instantaneously facilitate the flow of blood to that part of the human anatomy known as the penis or male organ resulting in the phenomenon which has been denominated by the faculty a morbid upwards and outwards philoprogenitive erection articulo mortis per diminutionem capitis So of course the citizen was only waiting for the wink of the word and he starts gassing out of him about the invincibles and the old guard and the men of sixtyseven and who fears to speak of ninetyeight and Joe with him about all the fellows that were hanged drawn and transported for the cause by drumhead courtmartial and a new Ireland and new this that and the other	1.8329807108324359
Talking about new Ireland he ought to go and get a new dog so he ought	370.0769701290997
Mangy ravenous brute sniffing and sneezing all round the place and scratching his scabs	264.5328023082284
And round he goes to Bob Doran that was standing Alf a half one sucking up for what he could get	187.38174228603845
So of course Bob Doran starts doing the bloody fool with him Give us the paw	383.5657796031243
Give the paw doggy	541514.221341014
Good old doggy	10463057.02191373
Give the paw here	541514.221341014
Give us the paw	507122.5415477305
Arrah bloody end to the paw he d paw and Alf trying to keep him from tumbling off the bloody stool atop of the bloody old dog and he talking all kinds of drivel about training by kindness and thoroughbred dog and intelligent dog give you the bloody pip	10.0
Then he starts scraping a few bits of old biscuit out of the bottom of a Jacobs tin he told Terry to bring	121.15276586285881
Gob he golloped it down like old boots and his tongue hanging out of him a yard long for more	209.41852113238812
Near ate the tin and all hungry bloody mongrel	2109.8310755909374
And the citizen and Bloom having an argument about the point the brothers Sheares and Wolfe Tone beyond on Arbour Hill and Robert Emmet and die for your country the Tommy Moore touch about Sara Curran and she s far from the land	13.68874509537081
And Bloom of course with his knockmedown cigar putting on swank with his lardy face	525.600586221249
Phenomenon	3162277660168.3784
The fat heap he married is a nice old phenomenon with a back on her like a ballalley	428.1332398719392
Time they were stopping up in the pisser Burke told me there was an old one there with a cracked loodheramaun of a nephew and Bloom trying to get the soft side of her doing the mollycoddle playing bézique to come in for a bit of the wampum in her will and not eating meat of a Friday because the old one was always thumping her craw and taking the lout out for a walk	4.548777947003777
And one time he led him the rounds of Dublin and by the holy farmer he never cried crack till he brought him home as drunk as a boiled owl and he said he did it to teach him the evils of alcohol and by herrings if the three women didn t near roast him it s a queer story the old one Bloom s wife and Mrs O Dowd that kept the hotel	4.641588833612779
Jesus I had to laugh at pisser Burke taking them off chewing the fat	374.90135996966904
And Bloom with his don t you see and on the other	1670.111798063307
And sure more be token the lout I m told was in Power s after the blender s round in Cope street going home footless in a cab five times in the week after drinking his way through all the samples in the bloody establishment	12.216773489967919
The memory of the dead says the citizen taking up his pintglass and glaring at Bloom	416.02428078362624
Ay ay says Joe	415784.50464346824
You don t grasp my point says Bloom	4487.625186758295
What I mean is	1467748.1018948227

The children of the Male and Female Foundling Hospital who thronged the windows overlooking the scene were delighted with this unexpected addition to the day s entertainment and a word of praise is due to the Little Sisters of the Poor for their excellent idea of affording the poor fatherless and motherless children a genuinely instructive treat	7.2789538439831505

The arrival of the worldrenowned headsman was greeted by a roar of acclamation from the huge concourse the viceregal ladies waving their handkerchiefs in their excitement while the even more excitable foreign delegates cheered vociferously in a medley of cries banzai eljen zivio chinchin polla kronia hiphip vive amid which the ringing of the delegate of the land of song a high double F recalling those piercingly lovely notes with which the eunuch Catalani beglamoured our greatgreatgrandmothers was easily distinguishable	4.142704447847673
It was exactly seventeen o clock	22250.12476108353
The signal for prayer was then promptly given by megaphone and in an instant all heads were bared the commendatore s patriarchal sombrero which has been in the possession of his family since the revolution of Rienzi being removed by his medical adviser in attendance Dr Pippi	11.006941712522094

Hard by the block stood the grim figure of the executioner his visage being concealed in a tengallon pot with two circular perforated apertures through which his eyes glowered furiously	41.011270705513006
As he awaited the fatal signal he tested the edge of his horrible weapon by honing it upon his brawny forearm or decapitated in rapid succession a flock of sheep which had been provided by the admirers of his fell but necessary office	13.68874509537081
On a handsome mahogany table near him were neatly arranged the quartering knife the various finely tempered disembowelling appliances specially supplied by the worldfamous firm of cutlers Messrs John Round and Sons Sheffield a terra cotta saucepan for the reception of the duodenum colon blind intestine and appendix etc when successfully extracted and two commodious milkjugs destined to receive the most precious blood of the most precious victim	5.30441727984393

She brought back to his recollection the happy days of blissful childhood together on the banks of Anna Liffey when they had indulged in the innocent pastimes of the young and oblivious of the dreadful present they both laughed heartily all the spectators including the venerable pastor joining in the general merriment	8.778013135972484
That monster audience simply rocked with delight	7634.506815200031
But anon they were overcome with grief and clasped their hands for the last time	408.53799582686065
A fresh torrent of tears burst from their lachrymal ducts and the vast concourse of people touched to the inmost core broke into heartrending sobs not the least affected being the aged prebendary himself	26.826957952797255
Big strong men officers of the peace and genial giants of the royal Irish constabulary were making frank use of their handkerchiefs and it is safe to say that there was not a dry eye in that record assemblage	17.782794100389232
A most romantic incident occurred when a handsome young Oxford graduate noted for his chivalry towards the fair sex stepped forward and presenting his visiting card bankbook and genealogical tree solicited the hand of the hapless young lady requesting her to name the day and was accepted on the spot	9.55855309468529
Every lady in the audience was presented with a tasteful souvenir of the occasion in the shape of a skull and crossbones brooch a timely and generous act which evoked a fresh outburst of emotion and when the gallant young Oxonian the bearer by the way of one of the most timehonoured names in Albion s history placed on the finger of his blushing an expensive engagement ring with emeralds set in the form of a fourleaved shamrock the excitement knew no bounds	3.9376589235643866

Blimey it makes me kind of bleeding cry straight it does when I sees her cause I thinks of my old mashtub what s waiting for me down Limehouse way	41.011270705513006
So then the citizen begins talking about the Irish language and the corporation meeting and all to that and the shoneens that can t speak their own language and Joe chipping in because he stuck someone for a quid and Bloom putting in his old goo with his twopenny stump that he cadged off of Joe and talking about the Gaelic league and the antitreating league and drink the curse of Ireland	4.840960141478948
Antitreating is about the size of it	8522.03765402337

And one or two sky pilots having an eye around that there was no goings on with the females hitting below the belt	114.29300465137037
So howandever as I was saying the old dog seeing the tin was empty starts mousing around by Joe and me	142.81182788634436
I d train him by kindness so I would if he was my dog	830.6858561377725
Give him a rousing fine kick now and again where it wouldn t blind him	362.30906911084315
Afraid he ll bite you	79289.25621717887
says the citizen jeering	731825.2235555066
No says I	12393130.116106566
But he might take my leg for a lamppost	5494.172165265276
So he calls the old dog over	16702.558079205817
What s on you Garry	217925.7153018398
says he	566335270.0371672
Then he starts hauling and mauling and talking to him in Irish and the old towser growling letting on to answer like a duet in the opera	61.05402296585327
Such growling you never heard as they let off between them	1076.0447102928401
Someone that has nothing better to do ought to write a letter bono to the papers about the muzzling order for a dog the like of that	61.05402296585327
Growling and grousing and his eye all bloodshot from the drouth is in it and the hydrophobia dropping out of his jaws	149.24955450518294
All those who are interested in the spread of human culture among the lower animals and their name is legion should make a point of not missing the really marvellous exhibition of cynanthropy given by the famous old Irish red setter wolfdog formerly known by the of Garryowen and recently rechristened by his large circle of friends and acquaintances Owen Garry	6.40400427119728

The metrical system of the canine original which recalls the intricate alliterative and isosyllabic rules of the Welsh englyn is infinitely more complicated but we believe our readers will agree that the spirit has been well caught	20.691380811147894

As a matter of fact I just wanted to meet Martin Cunningham don t you see about this insurance of poor Dignam s	121.15276586285881
Martin asked me to go to the house	9593.168045107941
You see he Dignam I mean didn t serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and nominally under the act the mortgagee can t recover on the policy	29.552092352028872
Holy Wars says Joe laughing that s a good one if old Shylock is landed	341.66610578890493
So the wife comes out top dog what	5599.725998943318
Well that s a point says Bloom for the wife s admirers	1937.8424905582842
Whose admirers	530280962.0901607
says Joe	547981446.2614847
The wife s advisers I mean says Bloom	6741.4417182070465
Then he starts all confused mucking it up about mortgagor under the act like the lord chancellor giving it out on the bench and for the benefit of the wife and that a trust is created but on the other hand that Dignam owed Bridgeman the money and if now the wife or the widow contested the mortgagee s right till he near had the head of me addled with his mortgagor under the act	4.548777947003777
He was bloody safe he wasn t run in himself under the act that time as a rogue and vagabond only he had a friend in court	61.05402296585327

But should I have overstepped the limits of reserve let the sincerity of my feelings be the excuse for my boldness	153.9539883953715
No rejoined the other I appreciate to the full the motives which actuate your conduct and I shall discharge the office you entrust to me consoled by the reflection that though the errand be one of sorrow this proof of your confidence sweetens in some measure the bitterness of the cup	9.152473108773892
Then suffer me to take your hand said he	4202.021000208392
The goodness of your heart I feel sure will dictate to you better than my inadequate words the expressions which are most suitable to convey an emotion whose poignancy were I to give vent to my feelings would deprive me even of speech	13.68874509537081

Bloom was talking and talking with John Wyse and he quite excited with his dunducketymudcoloured mug on him and his old plumeyes rolling about	100.00000000000001
Persecution says he all the history of the world is full of it	900.876196358533
Perpetuating national hatred among nations	36880.39608292217
But do you know what a nation means	9483.250624597818

By God then says Ned laughing if that s so I m a nation for I m living in the same place for the past five years	61.05402296585327
So of course everyone had the laugh at Bloom and says he trying to muck out of it Or also living in different places	100.00000000000001
That covers my case says Joe	23374.923180379745

The scenes depicted on the emunctory field showing our ancient duns and raths and cromlechs and grianauns and seats of learning and maledictive stones are as wonderfully beautiful and the pigments as delicate as when the Sligo illuminators gave free rein to their artistic fantasy long long ago in the time of the Barmecides	8.11130830789687

What s that	8568323.4942259
says Joe	547981446.2614847
So the citizen takes up one of his paraphernalia papers and he starts reading out A delegation of the chief cotton magnates of Manchester was presented yesterday to His Majesty the Alaki of Abeakuta by Gold Stick in Waiting Lord Walkup of Walkup on Eggs to tender to His Majesty the heartfelt thanks of British traders for the facilities afforded them in his dominions	5.878016072274914
The delegation partook of luncheon at the conclusion of which the dusky potentate in the course of a happy speech freely translated by the British chaplain the reverend Ananias Praisegod Barebones tendered his best thanks to Massa Walkup and emphasised the cordial relations existing between Abeakuta and the British empire stating that he treasured as one of his dearest possessions an illuminated bible the volume of the word of God and the secret of England s greatness graciously presented to him by the white chief woman the great squaw Victoria with a personal dedication from the august hand of the Royal Donor	3.0579958606136803
The Alaki then drank a lovingcup of firstshot usquebaugh to the toast and from the skull of his immediate predecessor in the dynasty Kakachakachak surnamed Forty Warts after which he visited the chief factory of Cottonopolis and signed his mark in the visitors book subsequently executing a charming old Abeakutic wardance in the course of which he swallowed several knives and forks amid hilarious applause from the girl hands	5.179474679231211
Widow woman says Ned	294646.7228799763
I wouldn t doubt her	157661.1201226732
Wonder did he put that bible to the same use as I would	1104.6872609503841
Same only more so says Lenehan	24530.489453300266
And thereafter in that fruitful land the broadleaved mango flourished exceedingly	854.1237349858657
Is that by Griffith	778921.4887513197

It s only initialled P	110343.87968155758
And a very good initial too says Joe	6125.108292860474
That s how it s worked says the citizen	3303.449097895345
Trade follows the flag	234165.31703111363

Is it that whiteeyed kaffir	103598.89070316851
says the citizen that never backed a horse in anger in his life	587.755264746311
That s where he s gone says Lenehan	6988.175311164412
I met Bantam Lyons going to back that horse only I put him off it and he told me Bloom gave him the tip	100.00000000000001
Bet you what you like he has a hundred shillings to five on	784.3398858042344

So anyhow when I got back they were at it dingdong John Wyse saying it was Bloom gave the ideas for Sinn Fein to Griffith to put in his paper all kinds of jerrymandering packed juries and swindling the taxes off of the government and appointing consuls all over the world to walk about selling Irish industries	7.2789538439831505

And there s the man now that ll tell you all about it Martin Cunningham	652.2484816961598
Sure enough the castle car drove up with Martin on it and Jack Power with him and a fellow named Crofter or Crofton pensioner out of the collector general s an orangeman Blackburn does have on the registration and he drawing his pay or Crawford gallivanting around the country at the king s expense	8.11130830789687

Give you good den my masters said he with an obsequious bow	820.3400916699841
Bestir thyself sirrah	3011649.108042566

Look to our steeds	796063.0437082789
And for ourselves give us of your best for ifaith we need it	566.1668644562106
Lackaday good masters said the host my poor house has but a bare larder	376.695837875477

A poor house and a bare larder quotha	9564.434366948622

says Lenehan	1118029992.7647805
Defrauding widows and orphans	222788.4572714605
Isn t that a fact says John Wyse what I was telling the citizen about Bloom and the Sinn Fein	229.12526832577623
That s so says Martin	174129.33777582095
Or so they allege	729999.2324377627

Only namesakes	1004444179.8077648
His name was Virag the father s name that poisoned himself	1449.5316856569182
He changed it by deedpoll the father did	7706.56584541406
That s the new Messiah for Ireland	13991.971811111913
says the citizen	6081030.766130559
Island of saints and sages	68885.72343811125
Well they re still waiting for their redeemer says Martin	1765.7407506166232

Expecting every moment will be his next says Lenehan	2189.1119016059984
O by God says Ned you should have seen Bloom before that son of his that died was born	247.7000462239167

Well there were two children born anyhow says Jack Power	1349.2024197345531
And who does he suspect	167099.77344000145

Gob there s many a true word spoken in jest	1383.0585833892515

Do you know what I m telling you	4939.126630384839
It d be an act of God to take a hold of a fellow the like of that and throw him in the bloody sea	83.76776400682921
Justifiable homicide so it would	44549.93131577197
Then sloping off with his five quid without putting up a pint of stuff like a man	334.74258961440484
Not as much as would blind your eye	4280.904166695451
Charity to the neighbour says Martin	28784.857969026667
But where is he	917707.3238561164

Many a time and oft were they wont to come there to that favourite nook to have a cosy chat beside the sparkling waves and discuss matters feminine Cissy Caffrey and Edy Boardman with the baby in the pushcar and Tommy and Jacky Caffrey two little curlyheaded boys dressed in sailor suits with caps to match and the name	6.812920690579612
M	3162277660168.3784
S	3162277660168.3784
printed on both	7406396.623217819
For Tommy and Jacky Caffrey were twins scarce four years old and very noisy and spoiled twins sometimes but for all that darling little fellows with bright merry faces and endearing ways about them	26.826957952797255
They were dabbling in the sand with their spades and buckets building castles as children do or playing with their big coloured ball happy as the day was long	46.415888336127786
And Edy Boardman was rocking the chubby baby to and fro in the pushcar while that young gentleman fairly chuckled with delight	110.40702729501265
He was but eleven months and nine days old and though still a tiny toddler was just beginning to lisp his first babyish words	100.00000000000001
Cissy Caffrey bent over to him to tease his fat little plucks and the dainty dimple in his chin	242.31525421478582
Now baby Cissy Caffrey said	94383.65264274938
Say out big big	519412.79021961975
And baby prattled after her A jink a jink a jawbo	911.5621351671856
Cissy Caffrey cuddled the wee chap for she was awfully fond of children so patient with little sufferers and Tommy Caffrey could never be got to take his castor oil unless it was Cissy Caffrey that held his nose and promised him the scatty heel of the loaf or brown bread with golden syrup on	7.813707376518094
What a persuasive power that girl had	9854.527603635266
But to be sure baby Boardman was as good as gold a perfect little dote in his new fancy bib	203.27066300510768
None of your spoilt beauties Flora MacFlimsy sort was Cissy Caffrey	522.8271321699652
A truerhearted lass never drew the breath of life always with a laugh in her gipsylike eyes and a frolicsome word on her cherryripe red lips a girl lovable in the extreme	32.74549162877729
And Edy Boardman laughed too at the quaint language of little brother	1007.0974516922564
But just then there was a slight altercation between Master Tommy and Master Jacky	551.5382743607805
Boys will be boys and our two twins were no exception to this golden rule	332.6365427845407
The apple of discord was a certain castle of sand which Master Jacky had built and Master Tommy would have it right go wrong that it was to be architecturally improved by a frontdoor like the Martello tower had	17.782794100389232
But if Master Tommy was headstrong Master Jacky was selfwilled too and true to the maxim that every little Irishman s house is his castle he fell upon his hated rival and to such purpose that the wouldbe assailant came to grief and alas to relate the coveted castle too	9.55855309468529
Needless to say the cries of discomfited Master Tommy drew the attention of the girl friends	296.9244424976358
Come here Tommy his sister called imperatively	9657.948755347954
At once	1265236332.8012862
And you Jacky for shame to throw poor Tommy in the dirty sand	752.2075066228999
Wait till I catch you for that	10450.304124028424
His eyes misty with unshed tears Master Tommy came at her call for their big sister s word was law with the twins	106.66509013056276
And in a sad plight he was too after his misadventure	2388.1543599482175
His little man o war top and unmentionables were full of sand but Cissy was a past mistress in the art of smoothing over life s tiny troubles and very quickly not one speck of sand was to be seen on his smart little suit	12.216773489967919
Still the blue eyes were glistening with hot tears that would well up so she kissed away the hurtness and shook her hand at Master Jacky the culprit and said if she was near him she wouldn t be far from him her eyes dancing in admonition	11.006941712522094
Nasty bold Jacky	4003629.2631204543
she cried	1310862113.858356
She put an arm round the little mariner and coaxed winningly What s your name	414.4666174181401
Butter and cream	4181771.525931064
Tell us who is your sweetheart spoke Edy Boardman	2581.948128542674
Is Cissy your sweetheart	569857.3944420307
Nao tearful Tommy said	232602.75341689464
Is Edy Boardman your sweetheart	105449.36684106814
Cissy queried	1171763779.9326339
Nao Tommy said	3665403.4551322507
I know Edy Boardman said none too amiably with an arch glance from her shortsighted eyes	296.17167516777357
I know who is Tommy s sweetheart	15663.86200814103
Gerty is Tommy s sweetheart	78144.92326195624
Nao Tommy said on the verge of tears	4900.432573241207
But who was Gerty	1358608.3857337611
Gerty MacDowell who was seated near her companions lost in thought gazing far away into the distance was in very truth as fair a specimen of winsome Irish girlhood as one could wish to see	24.484367468222267
She was pronounced beautiful by all who knew her though as folks often said she was more a Giltrap than a MacDowell	121.06082960260419
Her figure was slight and graceful inclining even to fragility but those iron jelloids she had been taking of late had done her a world of good much better than the Widow Welch s female pills and she was much better of those discharges she used to get and that tired feeling	8.778013135972484
The waxen pallor of her face was almost spiritual in its ivorylike purity though her rosebud mouth was a genuine Cupid s bow Greekly perfect	79.66312054908884
Her hands were of finely veined alabaster with tapering fingers and as white as lemonjuice and queen of ointments could make them though it was not true that she used to wear kid gloves in bed or take a milk footbath either	14.547578108480476
Bertha Supple told that once to Edy Boardman a deliberate lie when she was black out at daggers drawn with Gerty the girl chums had of course their little tiffs from time to time like the rest of mortals and she told her not to let on whatever she did that it was her that told her or she d never speak to her again	5.722367659350217
No	3162277660168.3784
Honour where honour is due	49514.43387591802
There was an innate refinement a languid queenly about Gerty which was unmistakably evidenced in her delicate hands and higharched instep	108.33293820387982
Had kind fate but willed her to be born a gentlewoman of high degree in her own right and had she only received the benefit of a good education Gerty MacDowell might easily have held her own beside any lady in the land and have seen herself exquisitely gowned with jewels on her brow and patrician suitors at her feet vying with one another to pay their devoirs to her	5.0608719869196825
Mayhap it was this the love that might have been that lent to her softlyfeatured face at whiles a look tense with suppressed meaning that imparted a strange yearning tendency to the beautiful eyes a charm few could resist	17.782794100389232
Why have women such eyes of witchery	9997.566675684497
Gerty s were of the bluest Irish blue set off by lustrous lashes and dark expressive brows	213.85029437205256
Time was when those brows were not so silkily seductive	1437.4942663472245
It was Madame Vera Verity directress of the Woman Beautiful page of the Princess Novelette who had first advised her to try eyebrowleine which gave that haunting expression to the eyes so becoming in leaders of fashion and she had never regretted it	13.68874509537081
Then there was blushing scientifically cured and how to be tall increase your height and you have a beautiful face but your nose	121.15276586285881
But Gerty s crowning glory was her wealth of wonderful hair	957.3083890142848
It was dark brown with a natural wave in it	2407.3888045284843
She had cut it that very morning on account of the new moon and it nestled about her pretty head in a profusion of luxuriant clusters and pared her nails too Thursday for wealth	26.826957952797255
And just now at Edy s words as a telltale flush delicate as the faintest rosebloom crept into her cheeks she looked so lovely in her sweet girlish shyness that of a surety God s fair land of Ireland did not hold her equal	12.91549665014884
For an instant she was silent with rather sad downcast eyes	1347.9577033174103
She was about to retort but something checked the words on her tongue	705.237496974375
Inclination prompted her to speak out dignity told her to be silent	804.0650435411314
The pretty lips pouted awhile but then she glanced up and broke out into a joyous little laugh which had in it all the freshness of a young May morning	41.011270705513006
She knew right well no one better what made squinty Edy say that because of him cooling in his attentions when it was simply a lovers quarrel	61.05402296585327
As per usual somebody s nose was out of joint about the boy that had the bicycle off the London bridge road always riding up and down in front of her window	32.74549162877729
Only now his father kept him in in the evenings studying hard to get an exhibition in the intermediate that was on and he was going to go to Trinity college to study for a doctor when he left the high school like his brother W	11.583232862547103
E	3162277660168.3784
Wylie who was racing in the bicycle races in Trinity college university	896.3970483883173
Little recked he perhaps for what she felt that dull aching void in her heart sometimes piercing to the core	152.036959709952
Yet he was young and perchance he might learn to love her in time	655.7469164564264
They were protestants in his family and of course Gerty knew Who came first and after Him the Blessed Virgin and then Saint Joseph	100.00000000000001
But he was undeniably handsome with an exquisite nose and he was what he looked every inch a gentleman the shape of his head too at the back without his cap on that she would know anywhere something off the common and the way he turned the bicycle at the lamp with his hands off the bars and also the nice perfume of those good cigarettes and besides they were both of a size too he and she and that was why Edy Boardman thought she was so frightfully clever because he didn t go and ride up and down in front of her bit of a garden	2.875514727952744
Gerty was dressed simply but with the instinctive taste of a votary of Dame Fashion for she felt that there was just a might that he might be out	46.415888336127786
She wore a coquettish little love of a hat of wideleaved nigger straw contrast trimmed with an underbrim of eggblue chenille and at the side a butterfly bow of silk to tone	32.74549162877729
All Tuesday week afternoon she was hunting to match that chenille but at last she found what she wanted at Clery s summer sales the very it slightly shopsoiled but you would never notice seven fingers two and a penny	16.57723885589317
She did it up all by herself and what joy was hers when she tried it on then smiling at the lovely reflection which the mirror gave back to her	41.011270705513006
And when she put it on the waterjug to keep the shape she knew that that would take the shine out of some people she knew	71.09709432312432
Her shoes were the newest thing in footwear Edy Boardman prided herself that she was very but she never had a foot like Gerty MacDowell a five and never would ash oak or elm with patent toecaps and just one smart buckle over her higharched instep	11.583232862547103
Her wellturned ankle displayed its perfect proportions beneath her skirt and just the proper amount and no more of her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and wide garter tops	29.552092352028872
As for undies they were Gerty s chief care and who that knows the fluttering hopes and fears of sweet seventeen though Gerty would never see seventeen again can find it in his heart to blame her	20.691380811147894
She had four dinky sets with awfully pretty stitchery three garments and nighties extra and each set slotted with different coloured ribbons rosepink pale blue mauve and peagreen and she aired them herself and blued them when they came home from the wash and ironed them and she had a brickbat to keep the iron on because she wouldn t trust those washerwomen as far as she d see them scorching the things	4.738879609717654
She was wearing the blue for luck hoping against hope her own colour and lucky too for a bride to have a bit of blue somewhere on her because the green she wore that day week brought grief because his father brought him in to study for the intermediate exhibition and because she thought perhaps he might be out because when she was dressing that morning she nearly slipped up the old pair on her inside out and that was for luck and lovers meeting if you put those things on inside out or if they got untied that he was thinking about you so long as it wasn t of a Friday	2.745342233838714
That strained look on her face	34257.12411054598
A gnawing sorrow is there all the time	6672.47269573476
Her very soul is in her eyes and she would give worlds to be in the privacy of her own familiar chamber where giving way to tears she could have a good cry and relieve her pentup feelings though not too much because she knew how to cry nicely before the mirror	8.778013135972484
You are lovely Gerty it said	27278.384597575434
The paly light of evening falls upon a face infinitely sad and wistful	578.6878438966963
Gerty MacDowell yearns in vain	61928.93890589416
Yes she had known from the very first that her daydream of a marriage has been arranged and the weddingbells ringing for Mrs Reggy Wylie T	71.09709432312432
C	3162277660168.3784
D	3162277660168.3784
because the one who married the elder brother would be Mrs Wylie and in the fashionable intelligence Mrs Gertrude Wylie was wearing a sumptuous confection of grey trimmed with expensive blue fox was not to be	22.456979955397745
He was too young to understand	53234.81499278397
He would not believe in love a woman s birthright	3937.6157202333516
The night of the party long ago in Stoer s he was still in short trousers when they were alone and he stole an arm round her waist she went white to the very lips	24.484367468222267
He called her little one in a strangely husky voice and snatched a half kiss the first but it was only the end of her nose and then he hastened from the room with a remark about refreshments	19.14481976169958
Impetuous fellow	310118385.0482162
Strength of character had never been Reggy Wylie s strong point and he who would woo and win Gerty MacDowell must be a man among men	71.09709432312432
But waiting always waiting to be asked and it was leap year too and would soon be over	293.30412418196886
No prince charming is her beau ideal to lay a rare and wondrous love at her feet but rather a manly man with a strong quiet face who had not found his ideal perhaps his hair slightly flecked with grey and who would understand take her in his sheltering arms strain her to him in all the strength of his deep passionate nature and comfort her with a long long kiss	4.948168092155143
For such a one she yearns this balmy summer eve	1397.1943813217968
With all the heart of her she longs to be his only his affianced bride for riches for poor in sickness in health till death us two part from this to this day forward	26.826957952797255
And while Edy Boardman was with little Tommy behind the pushcar she was just thinking would the day ever come when she could call herself his little wife to be	41.011270705513006
Then they could talk about her till they went blue in the face Bertha Supple too and Edy little spitfire because she would be twentytwo in November	61.05402296585327
She would care for him with creature comforts too for Gerty was womanly wise and knew that a mere man liked that feeling of hominess	83.76776400682921
Her griddlecakes done to a goldenbrown hue and queen Ann s pudding of delightful creaminess had won golden opinions from all because she had a lucky hand also for lighting a fire dredge in the fine selfraising flour and always stir in the same direction then cream the milk and sugar and whisk well the white of eggs though she didn t like the eating part when there were any people that made her shy and often she wondered why you couldn t eat something poetical like violets or roses and they would have a beautifully appointed drawingroom with pictures and engravings and the photograph of grandpapa Giltrap s lovely dog Garryowen that almost talked it was so human and chintz covers for the chairs and that silver toastrack in Clery s summer jumble sales like they have in rich houses	2.2496381902251934
He would be tall with broad shoulders she had always admired tall men for a husband with glistening white teeth under his carefully trimmed sweeping moustache and they would go on the continent for their honeymoon three wonderful weeks and then when they settled down in a nice snug and cosy little homely house every morning they would both have brekky simple but perfectly served for their own two selves and before he went out to business he would give his dear little wifey a good hearty hug and gaze for a moment deep down into her eyes	3.1992671377973836
Edy Boardman asked Tommy Caffrey was he done and he said yes so then she buttoned up his little knickerbockers for him and told him to run off and play with Jacky and to be good now and not to fight	15.505157798326243
But Tommy said he wanted the ball and Edy told him no that baby was playing with the ball and if he took it there d be wigs on the green but Tommy said it was his ball and he wanted his ball and he pranced on the ground if you please	8.778013135972484
The temper of him	1022929.3739977153
O he was a man already was little Tommy Caffrey since he was out of pinnies	560.7837607455327
Edy told him no no and to be off now with him and she told Cissy Caffrey not to give in to him	121.15276586285881
You re not my sister naughty Tommy said	4293.805380419239
It s my ball	1129645.6832577856
But Cissy Caffrey told baby Boardman to look up look up high at her finger and she snatched the ball quickly and threw it along the sand and Tommy after it in full career having won the day	19.14481976169958
Anything for a quiet life laughed Ciss	10621.847530162308
And she tickled tiny tot s two cheeks to make him forget and played here s the lord mayor here s his two horses here s his gingerbread carriage and here he walks in chinchopper chinchopper chinchopper chin	19.14481976169958
But Edy got as cross as two sticks about him getting his own way like that from everyone always petting him	150.56191396510872
I d like to give him something she said so I would where I won t say	415.7128570640513
On the beeoteetom laughed Cissy merrily	18133.489695469194
Gerty MacDowell bent down her head and crimsoned at the idea of Cissy saying an unladylike thing like that out loud she d be ashamed of her life to say flushing a deep rosy red and Edy Boardman said she was sure the gentleman opposite heard what she said	10.0
But not a pin cared Ciss	48529.43201412974
Let him	584614285.0305836
she said with a pert toss of her head and a piquant tilt of her nose	535.1999626823134
Give it to him too on the same place as quick as I d look at him	496.51414260566776
Madcap Ciss with her golliwog curls	16470.648335208643
You had to laugh at her sometimes	19657.677139621388
For instance when she asked you would you have some more Chinese tea and jaspberry ram and when she drew the jugs too and the men s faces on her nails with red ink make you split your sides or when she wanted to go where you know she said she wanted to run and pay a visit to the Miss White	6.218001087320917
That was just like Cissycums	183867.3030387751
O and will you ever forget her the evening she dressed up in her father s suit and hat and the burned cork moustache and walked down Tritonville road smoking a cigarette	32.74549162877729
There was none to come up to her for fun	3329.444207351544
But she was sincerity itself one of the bravest and truest hearts heaven ever made not one of your twofaced things too sweet to be wholesome	71.09709432312432
And then there came out upon the air the sound of voices and the pealing anthem of the organ	316.227766016838
It was the men s temperance retreat conducted by the missioner the reverend John Hughes S	305.28999512227824
J rosary sermon and benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament	1859.1813447259417
They were there gathered together without distinction of social class and a most edifying spectacle it was to see in that simple fane beside the waves after the storms of this weary world kneeling before the feet of the immaculate reciting the litany of Our Lady of Loreto beseeching her to intercede for them the old familiar words holy Mary holy virgin of virgins	5.878016072274914
How sad to poor Gerty s ears	11963.653845384126
Had her father only avoided the clutches of the demon drink by taking the pledge or those powders the drink habit cured in Pearson s Weekly she might now be rolling in her carriage second to none	20.691380811147894
Over and over had she told herself that as she mused by the dying embers in a brown study without the lamp because she hated two lights or oftentimes gazing out of the window dreamily by the hour at the rain falling on the rusty bucket thinking	11.006941712522094
But that vile decoction which has ruined so many hearths and homes had cast its shadow over her childhood days	105.52641674464004
Nay she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father a prey to the fumes of intoxication forget himself completely for if there was one thing of all things that Gerty knew it was that the man who lifts his hand to a woman save in the way of kindness deserves to be branded as the lowest of the low	4.948168092155143
And still the voices sang in supplication to the Virgin most powerful Virgin most merciful	350.0821425094778
And Gerty rapt in thought scarce saw or heard her companions or the twins at their boyish gambols or the gentleman off Sandymount green that Cissy Caffrey called the man that was so like himself passing along the strand taking a short walk	13.68874509537081
You never saw him any way screwed but still and for all that she would not like him for a father because he was too old or something or on account of his face it was a palpable case of Doctor Fell or his carbuncly nose with the pimples on it and his sandy moustache a bit white under his nose	6.40400427119728
With all his faults she loved him still when he sang me Mary how to woo or love and cottage near and they had stewed cockles and lettuce with Lazenby s salad dressing for supper and when he sang moon hath with Mr Dignam that died suddenly and was buried God have mercy on him from a stroke	7.038135554931555
Her mother s birthday that was and Charley was home on his holidays and Tom and Mr Dignam and Mrs and Patsy and Freddy Dignam and they were to have had a group taken	26.826957952797255
No one would have thought the end was so near	3234.297170312878
Now he was laid to rest	42931.68064805117
And her mother said to him to let that be a warning to him for the rest of his days and he couldn t even go to the funeral on account of the gout and she had to go into town to bring him the letters and samples from his office about Catesby s cork lino artistic standard designs fit for a palace gives tiptop wear and always bright and cheery in the home	4.641588833612779
A sterling good daughter was Gerty just like a second mother in the house a ministering angel too with a little heart worth its weight in gold	61.05402296585327
And when her mother had those raging splitting headaches who was it rubbed the menthol cone on her forehead but Gerty though she didn t like her mother s taking pinches of snuff and that was the only single thing they ever had words about taking snuff	11.006941712522094
Everyone thought the world of her for her gentle ways	3335.5101604229094
It was Gerty who turned off the gas at the main every night and it was Gerty who tacked up on the wall of that place where she never forgot every fortnight the chlorate of lime Mr Tunney the grocer s christmas almanac the picture of halcyon days where a young gentleman in the costume they used to wear then with a threecornered hat was offering a bunch of flowers to his ladylove with oldtime chivalry through her lattice window	4.142704447847673
You could see there was a story behind it	5028.504694589518
The colours were done something lovely	29769.981960558685
She was in a soft clinging white in a studied attitude and the gentleman was in chocolate and he looked a thorough aristocrat	121.15276586285881
She often looked at them dreamily when she went there for a certain purpose and felt her own arms that were white and soft just like hers with the sleeves back and thought about those times because she had found out in Walker s pronouncing dictionary that belonged to grandpapa Giltrap about the halcyon days what they meant	7.038135554931555
The twins were now playing in the most approved brotherly fashion till at last Master Jacky who was really as bold as brass there was no getting behind that deliberately kicked the ball as hard as ever he could down towards the seaweedy rocks	12.91549665014884
Needless to say poor Tommy was not slow to voice his dismay but luckily the gentleman in black who was sitting there by himself came gallantly to the rescue and intercepted the ball	29.552092352028872
Our two champions claimed their plaything with lusty cries and to avoid trouble Cissy Caffrey called to the gentleman to throw it to her please	83.76776400682921
The gentleman aimed the ball once or twice and then threw it up the strand towards Cissy Caffrey but it rolled down the slope and stopped right under Gerty s skirt near the little pool by the rock	19.14481976169958
The twins clamoured again for it and Cissy told her to kick it away and let them fight for it so Gerty drew back her foot but she wished their stupid ball hadn t come rolling down to her and she gave a kick but she missed and Edy and Cissy laughed	8.778013135972484
Gerty smiled assent and bit her lip	6679.133876983162
A delicate pink crept into her pretty cheek but she was determined to let them see so she just lifted her skirt a little but just enough and took good aim and gave the ball a jolly good kick and it went ever so far and the two twins after it down towards the shingle	7.813707376518094
Pure jealousy of course it was nothing else to draw attention on account of the gentleman opposite looking	236.68991668991308
She felt the warm flush a danger signal always with Gerty MacDowell surging and flaming into her cheeks	166.28109986922976
Till then they had only exchanged glances of the most casual but now under the brim of her new hat she ventured a look at him and the face that met her gaze there in the twilight wan and strangely drawn seemed to her the saddest she had ever seen	9.55855309468529
Through the open window of the church the fragrant incense was wafted and with it the fragrant names of her who was conceived without stain of original sin spiritual vessel pray for us honourable vessel pray for us vessel of singular devotion pray for us mystical rose	11.006941712522094
And careworn hearts were there and toilers for their daily bread and many who had erred and wandered their eyes wet with contrition but for all that bright with hope for the reverend father Father Hughes had told them what the great saint Bernard said in his famous prayer of Mary the most pious Virgin s intercessory power that it was not recorded in any age that those who implored her powerful protection were ever abandoned by her	4.294487988789274
The twins were now playing again right merrily for the troubles of childhood are but as fleeting summer showers	145.8031002717335
Cissy Caffrey played with baby Boardman till he crowed with glee clapping baby hands in air	198.05749406614274
Peep she cried behind the hood of the pushcar and Edy asked where was Cissy gone and then Cissy popped up her head and cried ah	71.09709432312432
and my word didn t the little chap enjoy that	3206.5918890560374
Say papa baby	7665400.164523072
Say pa pa pa pa pa pa pa	1965.9041982971553
And baby did his level best to say it for he was very intelligent for eleven months everyone said and big for his age and the picture of health a perfect little bunch of love and he would certainly turn out to be something great they said	11.006941712522094
Haja ja ja haja	186711.248936876
Cissy wiped his little mouth with the dribbling bib and wanted him to sit up properly and say pa pa pa but when she undid the strap she cried out holy saint Denis that he was possing wet and to double the half blanket the other way under him	10.0
Of course his infant majesty was most obstreperous at such toilet formalities and he let everyone know it Habaa baaaahabaaa baaaa	86.26765481991474
And two great big lovely big tears coursing down his cheeks	944.7382540508961
It was all no use soothering him with no nono baby no and telling him about the geegee and where was the puffpuff but Ciss always readywitted gave him in his mouth the teat of the suckingbottle and the young heathen was quickly appeased	12.91549665014884
Gerty wished to goodness they would take their squalling baby home out of that and not get on her nerves no hour to be out and the little brats of twins	36.51741272548377
She gazed out towards the distant sea	16783.013174981552
It was like the paintings that man used to do on the pavement with all the coloured chalks and such a pity too leaving them there to be all blotted out the evening and the clouds coming out and the Bailey light on Howth and to hear the music like that and the perfume of those incense they burned in the church like a kind of waft	5.4361836201538365
And while she gazed her heart went pitapat	5227.831390591915
Yes it was her he was looking at and there was meaning in his look	843.0126542047761
His eyes burned into her as though they would search her through and through read her very soul	204.42993859576626
Wonderful eyes they were superbly expressive but could you trust them	867.587314469112
People were so queer	579641.3106531694
She could see at once by his dark eyes and his pale intellectual face that he was a foreigner the image of the photo she had of Martin Harvey the matinee idol only for the moustache which she preferred because she wasn t stagestruck like Winny Rippingham that wanted they two to always dress the same on account of a play but she could not see whether he had an aquiline nose or a slightly from where he was sitting	4.142704447847673
He was in deep mourning she could see that and the story of a haunting sorrow was written on his face	187.38174228603845
She would have given worlds to know what it was	2421.168068920506
He was looking up so intently so still and he saw her kick the ball and perhaps he could see the bright steel buckles of her shoes if she swung them like that thoughtfully with the toes down	19.14481976169958
She was glad that something told her to put on the transparent stockings thinking Reggy Wylie might be out but that was far away	100.00000000000001
Here was that of which she had so often dreamed	3753.658502485758
It was he who mattered and there was joy on her face because she wanted him because she felt instinctively that he was like no one else	61.05402296585327
The very heart of the girlwoman went out to him her dreamhusband because she knew on the instant it was him	187.38174228603845
If he had suffered more sinned against than sinning or even even if he had been himself a sinner a wicked man she cared not	82.0479365763601
Even if he was a protestant or methodist she could convert him easily if he truly loved her	205.16756029362816
There were wounds that wanted healing with heartbalm	3530.5626974076977
She was a womanly woman not like other flighty girls unfeminine he had known those cyclists showing off what they hadn t got and she just yearned to know all to forgive all if she could make him fall in love with her make him forget the memory of the past	9.152473108773892
Then mayhap he would embrace her gently like a real man crushing her soft body to him and love her his ownest girlie for herself alone	71.09709432312432
Refuge of sinners	3516947.0744909034
Comfortress of the afflicted	895963.1273502603
pro	3162277660168.3784
Well has it been said that whosoever prays to her with faith and constancy can never be lost or cast away and fitly is she too a haven of refuge for the afflicted because of the seven dolours which transpierced her own heart	13.68874509537081
Gerty could picture the whole scene in the church the stained glass windows lighted up the candles the flowers and the blue banners of the blessed Virgin s sodality and Father Conroy was helping Canon O Hanlon at the altar carrying things in and out with his eyes cast down	9.55855309468529
He looked almost a saint and his confessionbox was so quiet and clean and dark and his hands were just like white wax and if ever she became a Dominican nun in their white habit perhaps he might come to the convent for the novena of Saint Dominic	10.481131341546856
He told her that time when she told him about that in confession crimsoning up to the roots of her hair for fear he could see not to be troubled because that was only the voice of nature and we were all subject to nature s laws he said in this life and that that was no sin because that came from the nature of woman instituted by God he said and that Our Blessed Lady herself said to the archangel Gabriel be it done unto me according to Thy Word	3.495250132675474
He was so kind and holy and often and often she thought and thought could she work a ruched teacosy with embroidered floral design for him as a present or a clock but they had a clock she noticed on the mantelpiece white and gold with a canarybird that came out of a little house to tell the time the day she went there about the flowers for the forty hours adoration because it was hard to know what sort of a present to give or perhaps an album of illuminated views of Dublin or some place	3.2374575428176438
The exasperating little brats of twins began to quarrel again and Jacky threw the ball out towards the sea and they both ran after it	83.76776400682921
Little monkeys common as ditchwater	69122.06410878041
Someone ought to take them and give them a good hiding for themselves to keep them in their places the both of them	121.15276586285881
And Cissy and Edy shouted after them to come back because they were afraid the tide might come in on them and be drowned	100.00000000000001
Jacky	3162277660168.3784
Tommy	3162277660168.3784
Not they	1489314721.3113678
What a great notion they had	38591.517794340536
So Cissy said it was the very last time she d ever bring them out	534.5236925685936
She jumped up and called them and she ran down the slope past him tossing her hair behind her which had a good enough colour if there had been more of it but with all the thingamerry she was always rubbing into it she couldn t get it to grow long because it wasn t natural so she could just go and throw her hat at it	5.4361836201538365
She ran with long gandery strides it was a wonder she didn t rip up her skirt at the side that was too tight on her because there was a lot of the tomboy about Cissy Caffrey and she was a forward piece whenever she thought she had a good opportunity to show off and just because she was a good runner she ran like that so that he could see all the end of her petticoat running and her skinny shanks up as far as possible	3.6998304144069647
It would have served her just right if she had tripped up over something accidentally on purpose with her high crooked French heels on her to make her look tall and got a fine tumble	24.484367468222267
That would have been a very charming exposé for a gentleman like that to witness	692.0661762906269
Queen of angels queen of patriarchs queen of prophets of all saints they prayed queen of the most holy rosary and then Father Conroy handed the thurible to Canon O Hanlon and he put in the incense and censed the Blessed Sacrament and Cissy Caffrey caught the two twins and she was itching to give them a ringing good clip on the ear but she didn t because she thought he might be watching but she never made a bigger mistake in all her life because Gerty could see without looking that he never took his eyes off of her and then Canon O Hanlon handed the thurible back to Father Conroy and knelt down looking up at the Blessed Sacrament and the choir began to sing the and she just swung her foot in and out in time as the music rose and fell to the gosa cramen	2.154434690031884
Three and eleven she paid for those stockings in Sparrow s of George s street on the Tuesday no the Monday before Easter and there wasn t a brack on them and that was what he was looking at transparent and not at her insignificant ones that had neither shape nor form the cheek of her because he had eyes in his head to see the difference for himself	5.179474679231211
Cissy came up along the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a fortnight before like a rag on her back and a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature	6.218001087320917
Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl s shoulders a radiant little vision in sooth almost maddening in its sweetness	15.505157798326243
You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that	202.13895335061997
She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve	176.7945153582364
She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her breath caught as she caught the expression in his eyes	32.74549162877729
He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey	2067.9921108932335
Her woman s instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose	20.691380811147894
Edy Boardman was noticing it too because she was squinting at Gerty half smiling with her specs like an old maid pretending to nurse the baby	71.09709432312432
Irritable little gnat she was and always would be and that was why no one could get on with her poking her nose into what was no concern of hers	41.011270705513006
And she said to Gerty A penny for your thoughts	2794.8569669148374
replied Gerty with a smile reinforced by the whitest of teeth	1266.828271681326
I was only wondering was it late	19447.970786532558
And when Cissy came up Edy asked her the time and Miss Cissy as glib as you like said it was half past kissing time time to kiss again	46.415888336127786
Wait said Cissy I ll run ask my uncle Peter over there what s the time by his conundrum	237.63474799006448
So over she went and when he saw her coming she could see him take his hand out of his pocket getting nervous and beginning to play with his watchchain looking up at the church	24.484367468222267
Passionate nature though he was Gerty could see that he had enormous control over himself	385.6698184288461
One moment he had been there fascinated by a loveliness that made him gaze and the next moment it was the quiet gravefaced gentleman selfcontrol expressed in every line of his distinguishedlooking figure	29.552092352028872
His voice had a cultured ring in it and though he spoke in measured accents there was a suspicion of a quiver in the mellow tones	71.09709432312432
Cissy said thanks and came back with her tongue out and said uncle said his waterworks were out of order	213.4898115999622
Then they sang the second verse of the and Canon O Hanlon got up again and censed the Blessed Sacrament and knelt down and he told Father Conroy that one of the candles was just going to set fire to the flowers and Father Conroy got up and settled it all right and she could see the gentleman winding his watch and listening to the works and she swung her leg more in and out in time	4.3754793750741845
She felt a kind of a sensation rushing all over her and she knew by the feel of her scalp and that irritation against her stays that that thing must be coming on because the last time too was when she clipped her hair on account of the moon	10.0
If ever there was undisguised admiration in a man s passionate gaze it was there plain to be seen on that man s face	100.00000000000001
It is for you Gertrude MacDowell and you know it	2959.7889226850957
Edy began to get ready to go and it was high time for her and Gerty noticed that that little hint she gave had had the desired effect because it was a long way along the strand to where there was the place to push up the pushcar and Cissy took off the twins caps and tidied their hair to make herself attractive of course and Canon O Hanlon stood up with his cope poking up at his neck and Father Conroy handed him the card to read off and he read out de coelo praestitisti and Edy and Cissy were talking about the time all the time and asking her but Gerty could pay them back in their own coin and she just answered with scathing politeness when Edy asked her was she heartbroken about her best boy throwing her over	2.2369194702482695
Gerty winced sharply	7682540.22724813
A brief cold blaze shone from her eyes that spoke volumes of scorn immeasurable	445.3167210140078
It hurt O yes it cut deep because Edy had her own quiet way of saying things like that she knew would wound like the confounded little cat she was	41.011270705513006
Gerty s lips parted swiftly to frame the word but she fought back the sob that rose to her throat so slim so flawless so beautifully moulded it seemed one an artist might have dreamed of	22.456979955397745
She had loved him better than he knew	6035.846183229971
Lighthearted deceiver and fickle like all his sex he would never understand what he had meant to her and for an instant there was in the blue eyes a quick stinging of tears	29.552092352028872
Their eyes were probing her mercilessly but with a brave effort she sparkled back in sympathy as she glanced at her new conquest for them to see	61.05402296585327
O responded Gerty quick as lightning laughing and the proud head flashed up	657.8202215947746
I can throw my cap at who I like because it s leap year	563.3910780206634
Her words rang out crystalclear more musical than the cooing of the ringdove but they cut the silence icily	173.33561734600607
There was that in her young voice that told that she was not a one to be lightly trifled with	240.40991835099712
As for Mr Reggy with his swank and his bit of money she could just chuck him aside as if he was so much filth and never again would she cast as much as a second thought on him and tear his silly postcard into a dozen pieces	10.481131341546856
And if ever after he dared to presume she could give him one look of measured scorn that would make him shrivel up on the spot	71.09709432312432
Miss puny little Edy s countenance fell to no slight extent and Gerty could see by her looking as black as thunder that she was simply in a towering rage though she hid it the little kinnatt because that shaft had struck home for her petty jealousy and they both knew that she was something aloof apart in another sphere that she was not of them and never would be and there was somebody else too that knew it and saw it so they could put that in their pipe and smoke it	3.4034148825183075
Edy straightened up baby Boardman to get ready to go and Cissy tucked in the ball and the spades and buckets and it was high time too because the sandman was on his way for Master Boardman junior	19.14481976169958
And Cissy told him too that billy winks was coming and that baby was to go deedaw and baby looked just too ducky laughing up out of his gleeful eyes and Cissy poked him like that out of fun in his wee fat tummy and baby without as much as by your leave sent up his compliments to all and sundry on to his brandnew dribbling bib	5.4361836201538365
O my	1144875518.201487
Puddeny pie	310118385.0482162
protested Ciss	390722099.23233885
He has his bib destroyed	150080.6107371862
The slight claimed her attention but in two twos she set that little matter to rights	254.35511868696085
Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation and gave a nervous cough and Edy asked what and she was just going to tell her to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet seashore because Canon O Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands	3.2769055017089728
How moving the scene there in the gathering twilight the last glimpse of Erin the touching chime of those evening bells and at the same time a bat flew forth from the ivied belfry through the dusk hither thither with a tiny lost cry	12.91549665014884
And she could see far away the lights of the lighthouses so picturesque she would have loved to do with a box of paints because it was easier than to make a man and soon the lamplighter would be going his rounds past the presbyterian church grounds and along by shady Tritonville avenue where the couples walked and lighting the lamp near her window where Reggy Wylie used to turn his freewheel like she read in that book by Miss Cummins author of and other tales	3.75588809068008
For Gerty had her dreams that no one knew of	1817.042359472602
It was there she kept her girlish treasure trove the tortoiseshell combs her child of Mary badge the whiterose scent the eyebrowleine her alabaster pouncetbox and the ribbons to change when her things came home from the wash and there were some beautiful thoughts written in it in violet ink that she bought in Hely s of Dame Street for she felt that she too could write poetry if she could only express herself like that poem that appealed to her so deeply that she had copied out of the newspaper she found one evening round the potherbs	3.1992671377973836
thou real my ideal it was called by Louis J Walsh Magherafelt and after there was something about wilt thou ever and ofttimes the beauty of poetry so sad in its transient loveliness had misted her eyes with silent tears for she felt that the years were slipping by for her one by one and but for that one shortcoming she knew she need fear no competition and that was an accident coming down Dalkey hill and she always tried to conceal it	3.9376589235643866
But it must end she felt	37228.525577366614
If she saw that magic lure in his eyes there would be no holding back for her	307.0389645982975
Love laughs at locksmiths	471484.35009295127
She would make the great sacrifice	60386.95208409796
Her every effort would be to share his thoughts	3012.737996036602
Dearer than the whole world would she be to him and gild his days with happiness	319.95520420696005
There was the allimportant question and she was dying to know was he a married man or a widower who had lost his wife or some tragedy like the nobleman with the foreign name from the land of song had to have her put into a madhouse cruel only to be kind	8.778013135972484
But even if what then	147163.42251787474
Would it make a very great difference	13350.973498720836
From everything in the least indelicate her finebred nature instinctively recoiled	950.545465054297
She loathed that sort of person the fallen women off the accommodation walk beside the Dodder that went with the soldiers and coarse men with no respect for a girl s honour degrading the sex and being taken up to the police station	13.68874509537081
No no not that	812012.3981157354
They would be just good friends like a big brother and sister without all that other in spite of the conventions of Society with a big ess	61.05402296585327
Perhaps it was an old flame he was in mourning for from the days beyond recall	521.5973599089137
She thought she understood	1068021.5896383813
She would try to understand him because men were so different	1407.5024445162098
The old love was waiting waiting with little white hands stretched out with blue appealing eyes	293.379823457384
Heart of mine	6901554.240996075
She would follow her dream of love the dictates of her heart that told her he was her all in all the only man in all the world for her for love was the master guide	22.456979955397745
Nothing else mattered	6958250.421795809
Come what might she would be wild untrammelled free	2881.146826154744
Canon O Hanlon put the Blessed Sacrament back into the tabernacle and genuflected and the choir sang Dominum omnes and then he locked the tabernacle door because the benediction was over and Father Conroy handed him his hat to put on and crosscat Edy asked wasn t she coming but Jacky Caffrey called out O look Cissy	7.2789538439831505
And they all looked was it sheet lightning but Tommy saw it too over the trees beside the church blue and then green and purple	83.76776400682921
It s fireworks Cissy Caffrey said	28471.357830303394
And they all ran down the strand to see over the houses and the church helterskelter Edy with the pushcar with baby Boardman in it and Cissy holding Tommy and Jacky by the hand so they wouldn t fall running	16.57723885589317
Come on Gerty Cissy called	83672.44657211001
It s the bazaar fireworks	154573.50154965333
But Gerty was adamant	875476.5069939131
She had no intention of being at their beck and call	1271.9115404204804
If they could run like rossies she could sit so she said she could see from where she was	223.43485545348935
The eyes that were fastened upon her set her pulses tingling	1138.523705803341
She looked at him a moment meeting his glance and a light broke in upon her	496.67415308896386
Whitehot passion was in that face passion silent as the grave and it had made her his	333.66186284359617
His hands and face were working and a tremour went over her	891.1292780555923
She leaned back far to look up where the fireworks were and she caught her knee in her hands so as not to fall back looking up and there was no one to see only him and her when she revealed all her graceful beautifully shaped legs like that supply soft and delicately rounded and she seemed to hear the panting of his heart his hoarse breathing because she knew too about the passion of men like that hotblooded because Bertha Supple told her once in dead secret and made her swear she d never about the gentleman lodger that was staying with them out of the Congested Districts Board that had pictures cut out of papers of those skirtdancers and highkickers and she said he used to do something not very nice that you could imagine sometimes in the bed	2.2496381902251934
But this was altogether different from a thing like that because there was all the difference because she could almost feel him draw her face to his and the first quick hot touch of his handsome lips	20.691380811147894
Besides there was absolution so long as you didn t do the other thing before being married and there ought to be women priests that would understand without your telling out and Cissy Caffrey too sometimes had that dreamy kind of dreamy look in her eyes so that she too my dear and Winny Rippingham so mad about actors photographs and besides it was on account of that other thing coming on the way it did	4.460162165376301
And Jacky Caffrey shouted to look there was another and she leaned back and the garters were blue to match on account of the transparent and they all saw it and they all shouted to look look there it was and she leaned back ever so far to see the fireworks and something queer was flying through the air a soft thing to and fro dark	5.575305334261898
And she saw a long Roman candle going up over the trees up up and in the tense hush they were all breathless with excitement as it went higher and higher and she had to lean back more and more to look up after it high high almost out of sight and her face was suffused with a divine an entrancing blush from straining back and he could see her other things too nainsook knickers the fabric that caresses the skin better than those other pettiwidth the green four and eleven on account of being white and she let him and she saw that he saw and then it went so high it went out of sight a moment and she was trembling in every limb from being bent so far back that he had a full view high up above her knee where no one ever not even on the swing or wading and she wasn t ashamed and he wasn t either to look in that immodest way like that because he couldn t resist the sight of the wondrous revealment half offered like those skirtdancers behaving so immodest before gentlemen looking and he kept on looking looking	1.7731938603987991
She would fain have cried to him chokingly held out her snowy slender arms to him to come to feel his lips laid on her white brow the cry of a young girl s love a little strangled cry wrung from her that cry that has rung through the ages	9.55855309468529
And then a rocket sprang and bang shot blind blank and O	575.3925313491878
then the Roman candle burst and it was like a sigh of O	942.25183088238
and everyone cried O	1314377.0578753168
O	3162277660168.3784
they were all greeny dewy stars falling with golden O so lovely O soft sweet soft	189.43140336881157
Then all melted away dewily in the grey air all was silent	815.101353636203
Ah	3162277660168.3784
She glanced at him as she bent forward quickly a pathetic little glance of piteous protest of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl	71.09709432312432
He was leaning back against the rock behind	8627.615430198783
Leopold Bloom for it is he stands silent with bowed head before those young guileless eyes	306.5281220840716
What a brute he had been	33584.680287348965
At it again	10080921.333198078
A fair unsullied soul had called to him and wretch that he was how had he answered	338.1613784520641
An utter cad he had been	19657.59351851495
He of all men	2081128.0160587337
But there was an infinite store of mercy in those eyes for him too a word of pardon even though he had erred and sinned and wandered	61.05402296585327
Should a girl tell	476483.6556701249
No a thousand times no	125087.4143439027
That was their secret only theirs alone in the hiding twilight and there was none to know or tell save the little bat that flew so softly through the evening to and fro and little bats don t tell	17.782794100389232
Cissy Caffrey whistled imitating the boys in the football field to show what a great person she was and then she cried Gerty	121.15276586285881
Gerty	3162277660168.3784
We re going	10831882.000903634

She rose	1742450348.0977805
Was it goodbye	8721797.886860289
No	3162277660168.3784
She had to go but they would meet again there and she would dream of that till then tomorrow of her dream of yester eve	83.76776400682921
She drew herself up to her full height	8801.57705908499
Their souls met in a last lingering glance and the eyes that reached her heart full of a strange shining hung enraptured on her sweet flowerlike face	61.05402296585327
She half smiled at him wanly a sweet forgiving smile a smile that verged on tears and then they parted	138.21316129408123
Slowly without looking back she went down the uneven strand to Cissy to Edy to Jacky and Tommy Caffrey to little baby Boardman	87.46687469688825
It was darker now and there were stones and bits of wood on the strand and slippy seaweed	263.9556613464469
She walked with a certain quiet dignity characteristic of her but with care and very slowly because because Gerty MacDowell was	187.38174228603845
Tight boots	563503884.8737106

But then why don t all women menstruate at the same time with the same moon I mean	307.3572552533962
Depends on the time they were born I suppose	3920.232749934394

Fifteen she told me	368571.2467996762
But her breasts were developed	96248.2548984284
Fell asleep then	4364880.207079208
After Glencree dinner that was when we drove home	3748.6795151493047
Featherbed mountain	390722099.23233885
Gnashing her teeth in sleep	50603.32051660187
Lord mayor had his eye on her too	9456.40179709418
Val Dillon	310118385.0482162
Apoplectic	3162277660168.3784
There she is with them down there for the fireworks	4632.959966681961
My fireworks	1515619770.410867
Up like a rocket down like a stick	7659.550208240028
And the children twins they must be waiting for something to happen	1180.1764454465103
Want to be grownups	887387.9829907047
Dressing in mother s clothes	69448.52407650561
Time enough understand all the ways of the world	3566.275671806573
And the dark one with the mop head and the nigger mouth	1764.522753410952
I knew she could whistle	267125.72377219633
Mouth made for that	459226.41039296874
Like Molly	1213599434.4676678
Why that highclass whore in Jammet s wore her veil only to her nose	403.0647868569825
Would you mind please telling me the right time	3177.726131379085
Say prunes and prisms forty times every morning cure for fat lips	403.6345895095723
Caressing the little boy too	83530.35706155209
Onlookers see most of the game	27397.183710943755
Of course they understand birds animals babies	7048.441117287886
In their line	13969342.87666899
Wouldn t give that satisfaction	91105.83906159695
Those girls those girls those lovely seaside girls	3171.6403709610736
Fine eyes she had clear	125822.311123542
It s the white of the eye brings that out not so much the pupil	651.0449544529357
Did she know what I	95952.3935598292
Course	3162277660168.3784
Like a cat sitting beyond a dog s jump	2725.600006146478
Women never meet one like that Wilkins in the high school drawing a picture of Venus with all his belongings on show	134.98055459535473
Call that innocence	6544627.746329504
Poor idiot	1086166761.5235136
His wife has her work cut out for her	3159.3326744284514
Never see them sit on a bench marked	7526.177595223978
Eyes all over them	686923.8111733652
Look under the bed for what s not there	6717.662706508965
Longing to get the fright of their lives	4453.8217330904035
Sharp as needles they are	37095.26675015358
When I said to Molly the man at the corner of Cuffe street was goodlooking thought she might like twigged at once he had a false arm	61.05402296585327
Had too	906647884.794526
Where do they get that	137201.85056109296
Typist going up Roger Greene s stairs two at a time to show her understandings	278.3941682167526
Handed down from father to mother to daughter I mean	1202.5590571478872
Bred in the bone	677823.6746583931
Milly for example drying her handkerchief on the mirror to save the ironing	689.1801151048371
Best place for an ad to catch a woman s eye on a mirror	799.5946828107712
Clever little minx	5495675.299446946
I never told her	1079470.3829817649
Neat way she carries parcels too	14938.019598601153
Attract men small thing like that	11274.408916427337
Holding up her hand shaking it to let the blood flow back when it was red	456.0876782275876
Who did you learn that from	42161.573781956016
Nobody	3162277660168.3784
Something the nurse taught me	78366.43665298769
O don t they know	184558.69718455515
Three years old she was in front of Molly s dressingtable just before we left Lombard street west	215.73691057578947
Me have a nice pace	185700.5582112621
Mullingar	3162277660168.3784
Who knows	959126797.1601683
Ways of the world	452519.84945057373
Young student	530280962.0901607
Straight on her pins anyway not like the other	2495.75625350815
Still she was game	1232045.112764528
Lord I am wet	1182309.0184780108
Devil you are	5440009.665502597
Swell of her calf	797171.1189321539
Transparent stockings stretched to breaking point	10630.858222343182
Not like that frump today	146927.98892377052
A	3162277660168.3784
E	3162277660168.3784
Rumpled stockings	310118385.0482162
Or the one in Grafton street	35966.60228463801
White	3162277660168.3784
Wow	3162277660168.3784
Beef to the heel	706454.055925702
A monkey puzzle rocket burst spluttering in darting crackles	1620.4422041822697
Zrads and zrads zrads zrads	32316.541663247226
Will she	834614576.4197769
Watch	3162277660168.3784
Watch	3162277660168.3784
See	3162277660168.3784
Looked round	492272491.38334554
She smelt an onion	743871.5095540661
Darling I saw your	602723.54517602
I saw all	21166357.097929854
Lord	3162277660168.3784
Did me good all the same	26958.653365405877
Off colour after Kiernan s Dignam s	6604.386997745489
For this relief much thanks	74496.00752380506
In that is	13856065.426341275
Lord	3162277660168.3784
It was all things combined	195951.4291973405
Excitement	3162277660168.3784
When she leaned back felt an ache at the butt of my tongue	635.0592360949531
Your head it simply swirls	71358.99170194278
He s right	18249724.34112832
Might have made a worse fool of myself however	2588.85520801534
Instead of talking about nothing	65814.30810249763
Then I will tell you all	34228.64977980177
Still it was a kind of language between us	4255.068324766297
It couldn t be	1028620.0381782944
No Gerty they called her	132051.50905593863
Might be false name however like my name and the address Dolphin s barn a blind	297.33105736232324
Her maiden name was Jemina Brown And she lived with her mother in Irishtown	504.51535546728655
Place made me think of that I suppose	6941.006545172594
All tarred with the same brush	59110.340596303344
Wiping pens in their stockings	75243.34122197803
But the ball rolled down to her as if it understood	2360.478250423426
Every bullet has its billet	66300.53481085347
Course I never could throw anything straight at school	1937.5958338514818
Crooked as a ram s horn	23766.643134080132
Sad however because it lasts only a few years till they settle down to potwalloping and papa s pants will soon fit Willy and fuller s earth for the baby when they hold him out to do ah ah	17.782794100389232
No soft job	13782819.962611694
Saves them	310118385.0482162
Keeps them out of harm s way	9309.82436538199
Nature	3162277660168.3784
Washing child washing corpse	267071.3912244507
Dignam	3162277660168.3784
Children s hands always round them	14822.576535022856
Cocoanut skulls monkeys not even closed at first sour milk in their swaddles and tainted curds	186.65039769724825
Oughtn t to have given that child an empty teat to suck	538.5268648945636
Fill it up with wind	123844.81255132216
Mrs Beaufoy Purefoy	9550054.746480001
Must call to the hospital	202433.66095643264
Wonder is nurse Callan there still	18104.134979660157
She used to look over some nights when Molly was in the Coffee Palace	614.0239785711946
That young doctor O Hare I noticed her brushing his coat	863.9800233289368
And Mrs Breen and Mrs Dignam once like that too marriageable	1827.7655866259113
Worst of all at night Mrs Duggan told me in the City Arms	736.1444970440832
Husband rolling in drunk stink of pub off him like a polecat	573.1181860344545
Have that in your nose in the dark whiff of stale boose	1306.177606790996
Then ask in the morning was I drunk last night	2409.658279176782
Bad policy however to fault the husband	5762.402596927772
Chickens come home to roost	70127.14089765541
They stick by one another like glue	14958.592095381156
Maybe the women s fault also	24949.416510978837
That s where Molly can knock spots off them	1975.7415747524294
It s the blood of the south	20108.45481262538
Moorish	3162277660168.3784
Also the form the figure	112353.55950966255
Hands felt for the opulent	100950.80170528799
Just compare for instance those others	24718.981372725204
Wife locked up at home skeleton in the cupboard	4512.899532715143
Allow me to introduce my	91683.59056718068
Then they trot you out some kind of a nondescript wouldn t know what to call her	325.38468634295754
Always see a fellow s weak point in his wife	2235.997419001478
Still there s destiny in it falling in love	3318.521069946154
Have their own secrets between them	26360.458090650318
Chaps that would go to the dogs if some woman didn t take them in hand	403.14280574853956
Then little chits of girls height of a shilling in coppers with little hubbies	446.1284050227397
As God made them he matched them	10480.430362376223
Sometimes children turn out well enough	16688.29820010793
Twice nought makes one	289653.7367454186
Or old rich chap of seventy and blushing bride	1603.5469403381476
Marry in May and repent in December	4977.40219738724
This wet is very unpleasant	102439.98670656762
Stuck	3162277660168.3784
Well the foreskin is not back	29209.28230780248
Better detach	1042355577.0039501
Ow	3162277660168.3784
Other hand a sixfooter with a wifey up to his watchpocket	1727.5969649390788
Long and the short of it	48002.25122526809
Big he and little she	137151.37074841806
Wristwatches are always going wrong	55330.362803473625
Wonder is there any magnetic influence between the person because that was about the time he	477.95490493835433
Yes I suppose at once	147102.39667825974
Cat s away the mice will play	6322.956113628423
I remember looking in Pill lane	35770.469719476925
Also that now is magnetism	110416.98303971997
Back of everything magnetism	438870.9326703457
Earth for instance pulling this and being pulled	3525.8051522205365
That causes movement	13824451.455220977
And time well that s the time the movement takes	3104.5844021961134
Then if one thing stopped the whole ghesabo would stop bit by bit	518.4040512327033
Because it s all arranged	189239.1426842945
Magnetic needle tells you what s going on in the sun the stars	664.6144934560349
Little piece of steel iron	109316.2583506132
When you hold out the fork	37152.03840260157

Dress up and look and suggest and let you see and see more and defy you if you re a man to see that and like a sneeze coming legs look look and if you have any guts in you	16.57723885589317
Tip	3162277660168.3784
Have to let fly	783730.6146120075
Wonder how is she feeling in that region	7390.192735311337
Shame all put on before third person	7257.885464453217
More put out about a hole in her stocking	4452.381078324205
Molly her underjaw stuck out head back about the farmer in the ridingboots and spurs at the horse show	210.67667188556
And when the painters were in Lombard street west	2708.8858591713483
Fine voice that fellow had	108600.04904055633
How Giuglini began	9561292.547690907
Smell that I did	677571.5087656472
Like flowers	1213599434.4676678
It was too	11304159.071450196
Violets	3162277660168.3784
Came from the turpentine probably in the paint	7612.61268980982
Make their own use of everything	33744.052854875954
Same time doing it scraped her slipper on the floor so they wouldn t hear	328.49446038695777
But lots of them can t kick the beam I think	1473.022023130843
Keep that thing up for hours	31919.837953626913
Kind of a general all round over me and half down my back	817.8129138562192
Wait	3162277660168.3784
Hm	3162277660168.3784
Hm	3162277660168.3784
Yes	3162277660168.3784
That s her perfume	743669.1501955353
Why she waved her hand	90597.38882157738
I leave you this to think of me when I m far away on the pillow	605.4809075438096
What is it	7934065.714984031
Heliotrope	3162277660168.3784
No	3162277660168.3784
Hyacinth	3162277660168.3784
Hm	3162277660168.3784
Roses I think	3494625.655579131
She d like scent of that kind	22097.651531509873
Sweet and cheap soon sour	69574.01965311362
Why Molly likes opoponax	602171.6273844098
Suits her with a little jessamine mixed	11238.246505018584
Her high notes and her low notes	12050.888140331468
At the dance night she met him dance of the hours	1464.5048192956012
Heat brought it out	369261.2120842265
She was wearing her black and it had the perfume of the time before	1038.1299323125786
Good conductor is it	531843.0967145871
Or bad	1271399924.2459464
Light too	668090073.7856135
Suppose there s some connection	110417.42809377931
For instance if you go into a cellar where it s dark	1394.7733654727592
Mysterious thing too	4173496.7770539713
Why did I smell it only now	12889.995760596585
Suppose it s ever so many millions of tiny grains blown across	742.3086055471666
Yes it is	9054168.592114082
Because those spice islands Cinghalese this morning smell them leagues off	664.2139780919363
Tell you what it is	103846.65537111864
It s like a fine fine veil or web they have all over the skin fine like what do you call it gossamer and they re always spinning it out of them fine as anything like rainbow colours without knowing it	15.505157798326243
Clings to everything she takes off	12529.192378414793
Vamp of her stockings	639927.463593273
Warm shoe	530280962.0901607
Stays	3162277660168.3784
Drawers little kick taking them off	10786.960474046657
Byby till next time	298839.5710541512
Also the cat likes to sniff in her shift on the bed	900.5073421279799
Know her smell in a thousand	32049.811804641256
Bathwater too	310118385.0482162
Reminds me of strawberries and cream	14731.197778655507
Wonder where it is really	196291.44606724483
There or the armpits or under the neck	8023.562748269311
Because you get it out of all holes and corners	2462.0248160195165

Very well thank you	393909.7924397603
Animals go by that	310622.3072016504
Yes now look at it that way	18674.673378171454
We re the same	766480.9598147705
Some women instance warn you off when they have their period	1207.8618543143546
Come near	1399144341.294559

Potted herrings gone stale or	46860.35880970218
Boof	3162277660168.3784
Please keep off the grass	109938.55991486003
Perhaps they get a man smell off us	7076.183921267323
What though	2381570278.4997034
Cigary gloves long John had on his desk the other day	1135.2946873357841

No	3162277660168.3784
Mansmell I mean	3495118.0233874936
Must be connected with that because priests that are supposed to be are different	556.5734684620091
Women buzz round it like flies round treacle	4079.0270929439826
Railed off the altar get on to it at any cost	1887.5365332144868
The tree of forbidden priest	127153.4500138943
O father will you	823485.5891417656
Let me be the first to	38042.98466207915

The man hearkened to her words for he felt with wonder women s woe in the travail that they have of motherhood and he wondered to look on her face that was a fair face for any man to see but yet was she left after long years a handmaid	9.55855309468529
Nine twelve bloodflows chiding her childless	11224.453662745356
And whiles they spake the door of the castle was opened and there nighed them a mickle noise as of many that sat there at meat	71.09709432312432
And there came against the place as they stood a young learningknight yclept Dixon	727.5457728310253
And the traveller Leopold was couth to him sithen it had happed that they had had ado each with other in the house of misericord where this learningknight lay by cause the traveller Leopold came there to be healed for he was sore wounded in his breast by a spear wherewith a horrible and dreadful dragon was smitten him for which he did do make a salve of volatile salt and chrism as much as he might suffice	4.294487988789274
And he said now that he should go in to that castle for to make merry with them that were there	187.38174228603845
And the traveller Leopold said that he should go otherwhither for he was a man of cautels and a subtile	226.476593336972
Also the lady was of his avis and repreved the learningknight though she trowed well that the traveller had said thing that was false for his subtility	61.05402296585327
But the learningknight would not hear say nay nor do her mandement ne have him in aught contrarious to his list and he said how it was a marvellous castle	41.011270705513006
And the traveller Leopold went into the castle for to rest him for a space being sore of limb after many marches environing in divers lands and sometime venery	46.415888336127786
And in the castle was set a board that was of the birchwood of Finlandy and it was upheld by four dwarfmen of that country but they durst not move more for enchantment	29.552092352028872
And on this board were frightful swords and knives that are made in a great cavern by swinking demons out of white flames that they fix then in the horns of buffalos and stags that there abound marvellously	19.14481976169958
And there were vessels that are wrought by magic of Mahound out of seasand and the air by a warlock with his breath that he blases in to them like to bubbles	32.74549162877729
And full fair cheer and rich was on the board that no wight could devise a fuller ne richer	142.48258986306257
And there was a vat of silver that was moved by craft to open in the which lay strange fishes withouten heads though misbelieving men nie that this be possible thing without they see it natheless they are so	17.782794100389232
And these fishes lie in an oily water brought there from Portugal land because of the fatness that therein is like to the juices of the olivepress	61.05402296585327
And also it was a marvel to see in that castle how by magic they make a compost out of fecund wheatkidneys out of Chaldee that by aid of certain angry spirits that they do in to it swells up wondrously like to a vast mountain	11.583232862547103
And they teach the serpents there to entwine themselves up on long sticks out of the ground and of the scales of these serpents they brew out a brewage like to mead	32.74549162877729
And the learning knight let pour for childe Leopold a draught and halp thereto the while all they that were there drank every each	69.61130762341287
And childe Leopold did up his beaver for to pleasure him and took apertly somewhat in amity for he never drank no manner of mead which he then put by and anon full privily he voided the more part in his neighbour glass and his neighbour nist not of this wile	9.152473108773892
And he sat down in that castle with them for to rest him there awhile	661.7230504456124
Thanked be Almighty God	215444.70620149924
This meanwhile this good sister stood by the door and begged them at the reverence of Jesu our alther liege Lord to leave their wassailing for there was above one quick with child a gentle dame whose time hied fast	16.57723885589317
Sir Leopold heard on the upfloor cry on high and he wondered what cry that it was whether of child or woman and I marvel said he that it be not come or now	26.826957952797255
Meseems it dureth overlong	195883.39333762068
And he was ware and saw a franklin that hight Lenehan on that side the table that was older than any of the tother and for that they both were knights virtuous in the one emprise and eke by cause that he was elder he spoke to him full gently	9.55855309468529
But said he or it be long too she will bring forth by God His bounty and have joy of her childing for she hath waited marvellous long	52.983169062837085
And the franklin that had drunken said Expecting each moment to be her next	516.7529329113277
Also he took the cup that stood tofore him for him needed never none asking nor desiring of him to drink and Now drink said he fully delectably and he quaffed as far as he might to their both s health for he was a passing good man of his lustiness	9.152473108773892
And sir Leopold that was the goodliest guest that ever sat in scholars hall and that was the meekest man and the kindest that ever laid husbandly hand under hen and that was the very truest knight of the world one that ever did minion service to lady gentle pledged him courtly in the cup	7.813707376518094
Woman s woe with wonder pondering	22561.75221990141
Now let us speak of that fellowship that was there to the intent to be drunken an they might	316.227766016838
There was a sort of scholars along either side the board that is to wit Dixon yclept junior of saint Mary Merciable s with other his fellows Lynch and Madden scholars of medicine and the franklin that hight Lenehan and one from Alba Longa one Crotthers and young Stephen that had mien of a frere that was at head of the board and Costello that men clepen Punch Costello all long of a mastery of him erewhile gested and of all them reserved young Stephen he was the most drunken that demanded still of more mead and beside the meek sir Leopold	3.0579958606136803
But on young Malachi they waited for that he promised to have come and such as intended to no goodness said how he had broke his avow	61.05402296585327
And sir Leopold sat with them for he bore fast friendship to sir Simon and to this his son young Stephen and for that his languor becalmed him there after longest wanderings insomuch as they feasted him for that time in the honourablest manner	12.91549665014884
Ruth red him love led on with will to wander loth to leave	308.98091684387356
For they were right witty scholars	35858.9676708841
And he heard their aresouns each gen other as touching birth and righteousness young Madden maintaining that put such case it were hard the wife to die for so it had fallen out a matter of some year agone with a woman of Eblana in Horne s house that now was trespassed out of this world and the self night next before her death all leeches and pothecaries had taken counsel of her case	4.641588833612779
And they said farther she should live because in the beginning they said the woman should bring forth in pain and wherefore they that were of this imagination affirmed how young Madden had said truth for he had conscience to let her die	13.68874509537081
And not few and of these was young Lynch were in doubt that the world was now right evil governed as it was never other howbeit the mean people believed it otherwise but the law nor his judges did provide no remedy	14.547578108480476
A redress God grant	718175.1382986236
This was scant said but all cried with one acclaim nay by our Virgin Mother the wife should live and the babe to die	95.84642440975446
In colour whereof they waxed hot upon that head what with argument and what for their drinking but the franklin Lenehan was prompt each when to pour them ale so that at the least way mirth might not lack	17.782794100389232
Then young Madden showed all the whole affair and said how that she was dead and how for holy religion sake by rede of palmer and bedesman and for a vow he had made to Saint Ultan of Arbraccan her goodman husband would not let her death whereby they were all wondrous grieved	8.431909292866257
To whom young Stephen had these words following Murmur sirs is eke oft among lay folk	181.86573179172507
Both babe and parent now glorify their Maker the one in limbo gloom the other in purgefire	160.97236052595454
But gramercy what of those Godpossibled souls that we nightly impossibilise which is the sin against the Holy Ghost Very God Lord and Giver of Life	71.09709432312432
For sirs he said our lust is brief	5493.095402493023
We are means to those small creatures within us and nature has other ends than we	203.30636610223627
Then said Dixon junior to Punch Costello wist he what ends	715.1345817371264
But he had overmuch drunken and the best word he could have of him was that he would ever dishonest a woman whoso she were or wife or maid or leman if it so fortuned him to be delivered of his spleen of lustihead	12.91549665014884
Whereat Crotthers of Alba Longa sang young Malachi s praise of that beast the unicorn how once in the millennium he cometh by his horn the other all this while pricked forward with their jibes wherewith they did malice him witnessing all and several by saint Foutinus his engines that he was able to do any manner of thing that lay in man to do	5.722367659350217
Thereat laughed they all right jocundly only young Stephen and sir Leopold which never durst laugh too open by reason of a strange humour which he would not bewray and also for that he rued for her that bare whoso she might be or wheresoever	12.216773489967919
Then spake young Stephen orgulous of mother Church that would cast him out of her bosom of law of canons of Lilith patron of abortions of bigness wrought by wind of seeds of brightness or by potency of vampires mouth to mouth or as Virgilius saith by the influence of the occident or by the reek of moonflower or an she lie with a woman which her man has but lain with or peradventure in her bath according to the opinions of Averroes and Moses Maimonides	3.75588809068008
He said also how at the end of the second month a human soul was infused and how in all our holy mother foldeth ever souls for God s greater glory whereas that earthly mother which was but a dam to bear beastly should die by canon for so saith he that holdeth the fisherman s seal even that blessed Peter on which rock was holy church for all ages founded	4.948168092155143
All they bachelors then asked of sir Leopold would he in like case so jeopard her person as risk life to save life	96.67404048398666
That is truth pardy said Dixon and or I err a pregnant word	408.13582789438897
Which hearing young Stephen was a marvellous glad man and he averred that he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the Lord for he was of a wild manner when he was drunken and that he was now in that taking it appeared eftsoons	12.216773489967919
But sir Leopold was passing grave maugre his word by cause he still had pity of the terrorcausing shrieking of shrill women in their labour and as he was minded of his good lady Marion that had borne him an only manchild which on his eleventh day on live had died and no man of art could save so dark is destiny	6.218001087320917
And she was wondrous stricken of heart for that evil hap and for his burial did him on a fair corselet of lamb s wool the flower of the flock lest he might perish utterly and lie akeled for it was then about the midst of the winter and now sir Leopold that had of his body no manchild for an heir looked upon him his friend s son and was shut up in sorrow for his forepassed happiness and as sad as he was that him failed a son of such gentle courage for all accounted him of real parts so grieved he also in no less measure for young Stephen for that he lived riotously with those wastrels and murdered his goods with whores	2.4757157946593416
About that present time young Stephen filled all cups that stood empty so as there remained but little mo if the prudenter had not shadowed their approach from him that still plied it very busily who praying for the intentions of the sovereign pontiff he gave them for a pledge the vicar of Christ which also as he said is vicar of Bray	6.042963902381328
Now drink we quod he of this mazer and quaff ye this mead which is not indeed parcel of my body but my soul s bodiment	71.09709432312432

Be not afeard neither for any want for this will comfort more than the other will dismay	244.44648816395937
See ye here	9197147.066917315
And he showed them glistering coins of the tribute and goldsmith notes the worth of two pound nineteen shilling that he had he said for a song which he writ	41.011270705513006
They all admired to see the foresaid riches in such dearth of money as was herebefore	275.15817117129797
His words were then these as followeth Know all men he said time s ruins build eternity s mansions	144.9391900749346
What means this	16046622.046943806

And all cried out upon it for a very scurvy word	1738.4740282212808
A pregnancy without joy he said a birth without pangs a body without blemish a belly without bigness	169.30310830034574

Hereupon Punch Costello dinged with his fist upon the board and would sing a bawdy catch about a wench that was put in pod of a jolly swashbuckler in Almany which he did straightways now attack first three months she was not well Staboo when here nurse Quigley from the door angerly bid them hist ye should shame you nor was it not meet as she remembered them being her mind was to have all orderly against lord Andrew came for because she was jealous that no gasteful turmoil might shorten the honour of her guard	3.2769055017089728
It was an ancient and a sad matron of a sedate look and christian walking in habit dun beseeming her megrims and wrinkled visage nor did her hortative want of it effect for incontinently Punch Costello was of them all embraided and they reclaimed the churl with civil rudeness some and shaked him with menace of blandishments others whiles they all chode with him a murrain seize the dolt what a devil he would be at thou chuff thou puny thou got in peasestraw thou losel thou chitterling thou spawn of a rebel thou dykedropt thou abortion thou to shut up his drunken drool out of that like a curse of God ape the good sir Leopold that had for his cognisance the flower of quiet margerain gentle advising also the time s occasion as most sacred and most worthy to be most sacred	2.212216291070449
In Horne s house rest should reign	11801.875523456749
To be short this passage was scarce by when Master Dixon of Mary in Eccles goodly grinning asked young Stephen what was the reason why he had not cided to take friar s vows and he answered him obedience in the womb chastity in the tomb but involuntary poverty all his days	8.778013135972484
Master Lenehan at this made return that he had heard of those nefarious deeds and how as he heard hereof counted he had besmirched the lily virtue of a confiding female which was corruption of minors and they all intershowed it too waxing merry and toasting to his fathership	10.0
But he said very entirely it was clean contrary to their suppose for he was the eternal son and ever virgin	187.38174228603845
Thereat mirth grew in them the more and they rehearsed to him his curious rite of wedlock for the disrobing and deflowering of spouses as the priests use in Madagascar island she to be in guise of white and saffron her groom in white and grain with burning of nard and tapers on a bridebed while clerks sung kyries and the anthem novetur sexus omnis corporis till she was there unmaided	4.948168092155143
He gave them then a much admirable hymen minim by those delicate poets Master John Fletcher and Master Francis Beaumont that is in their s that was writ for a like twining of lovers bed to was the burden of it to be played with accompanable concent upon the virginals	9.55855309468529
Well met they were said Master Dixon joyed but harkee young sir better were they named Beau Mount and Lecher for by my troth of such a mingling much might come	36.51741272548377
Young Stephen said indeed to his best remembrance they had but the one doxy between them and she of the stews to make shift with in delights amorous for life ran very high in those days and the custom of the country approved with it	12.216773489967919

Loud on left Thor thundered in anger awful the hammerhurler	683.1250365553353
Came now the storm that hist his heart	2973.5081276419037
And Master Lynch bade him have a care to flout and witwanton as the god self was angered for his hellprate and paganry	96.18329771171351
And he that had erst challenged to be so doughty waxed wan as they might all mark and shrank together and his pitch that was before so haught uplift was now of a sudden quite plucked down and his heart shook within the cage of his breast as he tasted the rumour of that storm	7.813707376518094
Then did some mock and some jeer and Punch Costello fell hard again to his yale which Master Lenehan vowed he would do after and he was indeed but a word and a blow on any the least colour	17.782794100389232
But the braggart boaster cried that an old Nobodaddy was in his cups it was muchwhat indifferent and he would not lag behind his lead	83.76776400682921
But this was only to dye his desperation as cowed he crouched in Horne s hall	196.79722637395685
He drank indeed at one draught to pluck up a heart of any grace for it thundered long rumblingly over all the heavens so that Master Madden being godly certain whiles knocked him on his ribs upon that crack of doom and Master Bloom at the braggart s side spoke to him calming words to slumber his great fear advertising how it was no other thing but a hubbub noise that he heard the discharge of fluid from the thunderhead look you having taken place and all of the order of a natural phenomenon	3.359818286283782
But was young Boasthard s fear vanquished by Calmer s words	699.8565821337183
No for he had in his bosom a spike named Bitterness which could not by words be done away	231.3622312050016
And was he then neither calm like the one nor godly like the other	691.2526640741169
He was neither as much as he would have liked to be either	1268.1418749340207
But could he not have endeavoured to have found again as in his youth the bottle Holiness that then he lived withal	149.24955450518294
Indeed no for Grace was not there to find that bottle	1282.2287079720127
Heard he then in that clap the voice of the god Bringforth or what Calmer said a hubbub of Phenomenon	169.0877907905168
Why he could not but hear unless he had plugged him up the tube Understanding which he had not done	233.49458227394962
For through that tube he saw that he was in the land of Phenomenon where he must for a certain one day die as he was like the rest too a passing show	29.552092352028872
And would he not accept to die like the rest and pass away	933.1932788988829
By no means would he though he must nor would he make more shows according as men do with wives which Phenomenon has commanded them to do by the book Law	36.51741272548377
Then wotted he nought of that other land which is called Believe on Me that is the land of promise which behoves to the king Delightful and shall be for ever where there is no death and no birth neither wiving nor mothering at which all shall come as many as believe on it	8.11130830789687
Yes Pious had told him of that land and Chaste had pointed him to the way but the reason was that in the way he fell in with a certain whore of an eyepleasing exterior whose name she said is Bird in the Hand and she beguiled him wrongways from the true path by her flatteries that she said to him as Ho you pretty man turn aside hither and I will show you a brave place and she lay at him so flatteringly that she had him in her grot which is named Two in the Bush or by some learned Carnal Concupiscence	2.99357729472049
This was it what all that company that sat there at commons in Manse of Mothers the most lusted after and if they met with this whore Bird in the Hand which was within all foul plagues monsters and a wicked devil they would strain the last but they would make at her and know her	7.53690398089854
For regarding Believe on Me they said it was nought else but notion and they could conceive no thought of it for first Two in the Bush whither she ticed them was the very goodliest grot and in it were four pillows on which were four tickets with these words printed on them Pickaback and Topsyturvy and Shameface and Cheek by Jowl and second for that foul plague Allpox and the monsters they cared not for them for Preservative had given them a stout shield of oxengut and third that they might take no hurt neither from Offspring that was that wicked devil by virtue of this same shield which was named Killchild	2.745342233838714

But by and by as said this evening after sundown the wind sitting in the west biggish swollen clouds to be seen as the night increased and the weatherwise poring up at them and some sheet lightnings at first and after past ten of the clock one great stroke with a long thunder and in a brace of shakes all scamper pellmell within door for the smoking shower the men making shelter for their straws with a clout or kerchief womenfolk skipping off with kirtles catched up soon as the pour came	3.4485331776221058

Bloom there for a languor he had but was now better he having dreamed tonight a strange fancy of his dame Mrs Moll with red slippers on in a pair of Turkey trunks which is thought by those in ken to be for a change and Mistress Purefoy there that got in through pleading her belly and now on the stools poor body two days past her term the midwives sore put to it and can t deliver she queasy for a bowl of riceslop that is a shrewd drier up of the insides and her breath very heavy more than good and should be a bullyboy from the knocks they say but God give her soon issue	2.631286073895943

In sum an infinite great fall of rain and all refreshed and will much increase the harvest yet those in ken say after wind and water fire shall come for a prognostication of Malachi s almanac and I hear that Mr Russell has done a prophetical charm of the same gist out of the Hindustanish for his farmer s gazette to have three things in all but this a mere fetch without bottom of reason for old crones and bairns yet sometimes they are found in the right guess with their queerities no telling how	3.317671127842857
With this came up Lenehan to the feet of the table to say how the letter was in that night s gazette and he made a show to find it about him for he swore with an oath that he had been at pains about it but on Stephen s persuasion he gave over the search and was bidden to sit near by which he did mighty brisk	5.30441727984393
He was a kind of sport gentleman that went for a merryandrew or honest pickle and what belonged of women horseflesh or hot scandal he had it pat	52.983169062837085
To tell the truth he was mean in fortunes and for the most part hankered about the coffeehouses and low taverns with crimps ostlers bookies Paul s men runners flatcaps waistcoateers ladies of the bagnio and other rogues of the game or with a chanceable catchpole or a tipstaff often at nights till broad day of whom he picked up between his sackpossets much loose gossip	5.575305334261898
He took his ordinary at a boilingcook s and if he had but gotten into him a mess of broken victuals or a platter of tripes with a bare tester in his purse he could always bring himself off with his tongue some randy quip he had from a punk or whatnot that every mother s son of them would burst their sides	6.042963902381328
The other Costello that is hearing this talk asked was it poetry or a tale	482.0364890998331
Faith no he says Frank that was his name tis all about Kerry cows that are to be butchered along of the plague	121.15276586285881
But they can go hang says he with a wink for me with their bully beef a pox on it	230.42557271874486
There s as good fish in this tin as ever came out of it and very friendly he offered to take of some salty sprats that stood by which he had eyed wishly in the meantime and found the place which was indeed the chief design of his embassy as he was sharpset	8.431909292866257
aux says Frank then in the French language that had been indentured to a brandyshipper that has a winelodge in Bordeaux and he spoke French like a gentleman too	46.415888336127786
From a child this Frank had been a donought that his father a headborough who could ill keep him to school to learn his letters and the use of the globes matriculated at the university to study the mechanics but he took the bit between his teeth like a raw colt and was more familiar with the justiciary and the parish beadle than with his volumes	5.575305334261898
One time he would be a playactor then a sutler or a welsher then nought would keep him from the bearpit and the cocking main then he was for the ocean sea or to hoof it on the roads with the romany folk kidnapping a squire s heir by favour of moonlight or fecking maids linen or choking chicken behind a hedge	6.218001087320917
He had been off as many times as a cat has lives and back again with naked pockets as many more to his father the headborough who shed a pint of tears as often as he saw him	19.14481976169958

I can scarce believe tis so bad says he	2666.1492641138434
And he had experience of the like brood beasts and of springers greasy hoggets and wether wool having been some years before actuary for Mr Joseph Cuffe a worthy salesmaster that drove his trade for live stock and meadow auctions hard by Mr Gavin Low s yard in Prussia street	9.55855309468529
I question with you there says he	20335.857980606583
More like tis the hoose or the timber tongue	1940.467791600416
Mr Stephen a little moved but very handsomely told him no such matter and that he had dispatches from the emperor s chief tailtickler thanking him for the hospitality that was sending over Doctor Rinderpest the bestquoted cowcatcher in all Muscovy with a bolus or two of physic to take the bull by the horns	7.813707376518094
Come come says Mr Vincent plain dealing	9434.057053033213
He ll find himself on the horns of a dilemma if he meddles with a bull that s Irish says he	187.38174228603845
Irish by name and irish by nature says Mr Stephen and he sent the ale purling about an Irish bull in an English chinashop	100.00000000000001
I conceive you says Mr Dixon	47592.72646795257
It is that same bull that was sent to our island by farmer Nicholas the bravest cattlebreeder of them all with an emerald ring in his nose	61.05402296585327
True for you says Mr Vincent cross the table and a bullseye into the bargain says he and a plumper and a portlier bull says he never shit on shamrock	41.011270705513006
He had horns galore a coat of cloth of gold and a sweet smoky breath coming out of his nostrils so that the women of our island leaving doughballs and rollingpins followed after him hanging his bulliness in daisychains	17.782794100389232
What for that says Mr Dixon but before he came over farmer Nicholas that was a eunuch had him properly gelded by a college of doctors who were no better off than himself	29.552092352028872
So be off now says he and do all my cousin german the lord Harry tells you and take a farmer s blessing and with that he slapped his posteriors very soundly	32.74549162877729
But the slap and the blessing stood him friend says Mr Vincent for to make up he taught him a trick worth two of the other so that maid wife abbess and widow to this day affirm that they would rather any time of the month whisper in his ear in the dark of a cowhouse or get a lick on the nape from his long holy tongue than lie with the finest strapping young ravisher in the four fields of all Ireland	3.9376589235643866
Another then put in his word And they dressed him says he in a point shift and petticoat with a tippet and girdle and ruffles on his wrists and clipped his forelock and rubbed him all over with spermacetic oil and built stables for him at every turn of the road with a gold manger in each full of the best hay in the market so that he could doss and dung to his heart s content	4.3754793750741845
By this time the father of the faithful for so they called him was grown so heavy that he could scarce walk to pasture	100.00000000000001
To remedy which our cozening dames and damsels brought him his fodder in their apronlaps and as soon as his belly was full he would rear up on his hind quarters to show their ladyships a mystery and roar and bellow out of him in bulls language and they all after him	8.778013135972484
Ay says another and so pampered was he that he would suffer nought to grow in all the land but green grass for himself for that was the only colour to his mind and there was a board put up on a hillock in the middle of the island with a printed notice saying By the Lord Harry Green is the grass that grows on the ground	5.4361836201538365
And says Mr Dixon if ever he got scent of a cattleraider in Roscommon or the wilds of Connemara or a husbandman in Sligo that was sowing as much as a handful of mustard or a bag of rapeseed out he d run amok over half the countryside rooting up with his horns whatever was planted and all by lord Harry s orders	6.042963902381328
There was bad blood between them at first says Mr Vincent and the lord Harry called farmer Nicholas all the old Nicks in the world and an old whoremaster that kept seven trulls in his house and I ll meddle in his matters says he	12.216773489967919
I ll make that animal smell hell says he with the help of that good pizzle my father left me	211.92774891051616
But one evening says Mr Dixon when the lord Harry was cleaning his royal pelt to go to dinner after winning a boatrace he had spade oars for himself but the first rule of the course was that the others were to row with pitchforks he discovered in himself a wonderful likeness to a bull and on picking up a blackthumbed chapbook that he kept in the pantry he found sure enough that he was a lefthanded descendant of the famous champion bull of the Romans which is good bog Latin for boss of the show	3.2769055017089728
After that says Mr Vincent the lord Harry put his head into a cow s drinkingtrough in the presence of all his courtiers and pulling it out again told them all his new name	26.826957952797255
Then with the water running off him he got into an old smock and skirt that had belonged to his grandmother and bought a grammar of the bulls language to study but he could never learn a word of it except the first personal pronoun which he copied out big and got off by heart and if ever he went out for a walk he filled his pockets with chalk to write it upon what took his fancy the side of a rock or a teahouse table or a bale of cotton or a corkfloat	3.317671127842857
In short he and the bull of Ireland were soon as fast friends as an arse and a shirt	266.04281066049157
They were says Mr Stephen and the end was that the men of the island seeing no help was toward as the ungrate women were all of one mind made a wherry raft loaded themselves and their bundles of chattels on shipboard set all masts erect manned the yards sprang their luff heaved to spread three sheets in the wind put her head between wind and water weighed anchor ported her helm ran up the jolly Roger gave three times three let the bullgine run pushed off in their bumboat and put to sea to recover the main of America	3.1264357272238157
Which was the occasion says Mr Vincent of the composing by a boatswain of that rollicking chanty Pope Peter s but a pissabed	121.15276586285881
Mr Mulligan was civil enough to express some relish of it all the more as it jumped with a project of his own for the cure of the very evil that had been touched on	24.484367468222267
Whereat he handed round to the company a set of pasteboard cards which he had had printed that day at Mr Quinnell s bearing a legend printed in fair italics Malachi Mulligan	32.74549162877729
Fertiliser and Incubator	3516906.073474796
His project as he went on to expound was to withdraw from the round of idle pleasures such as form the chief business of sir Fopling Popinjay and sir Milksop Quidnunc in town and to devote himself to the noblest task for which our bodily organism has been framed	10.0
Well let us hear of it good my friend said Mr Dixon	1182.9112398857592
I make no doubt it smacks of wenching	5455.44626080987
Come be seated both	661690.9350808702
Tis as cheap sitting as standing	15323.131520971281
Mr Mulligan accepted of the invitation and expatiating upon his design told his hearers that he had been led into this thought by a consideration of the causes of sterility both the inhibitory and the prohibitory whether the inhibition in its turn were due to conjugal vexations or to a parsimony of the balance as well as whether the prohibition proceeded from defects congenital or from proclivities acquired	5.30441727984393
It grieved him plaguily he said to see the nuptial couch defrauded of its dearest pledges and to reflect upon so many agreeable females with rich jointures a prey to the vilest bonzes who hide their flambeau under a bushel in an uncongenial cloister or lose their womanly bloom in the embraces of some unaccountable muskin when they might multiply the inlets of happiness sacrificing the inestimable jewel of their sex when a hundred pretty fellows were at hand to caress this he assured them made his heart weep	3.5938136638046276
To curb this inconvenient which he concluded due to a suppression of latent heat having advised with certain counsellors of worth and inspected into this matter he had resolved to purchase in fee simple for ever the freehold of Lambay island from its holder lord Talbot de Malahide a Tory gentleman of note much in favour with our ascendancy party	6.601948484081891
He proposed to set up there a national fertilising farm to be named with an obelisk hewn and erected after the fashion of Egypt and to offer his dutiful yeoman services for the fecundation of any female of what grade of life soever who should there direct to him with the desire of fulfilling the functions of her natural	6.812920690579612
Money was no object he said nor would he take a penny for his pains	579.399725671851
The poorest kitchenwench no less than the opulent lady of fashion if so be their constructions and their tempers were warm persuaders for their petitions would find in him their man	36.51741272548377
For his nutriment he shewed how he would feed himself exclusively upon a diet of savoury tubercles and fish and coneys there the flesh of these latter prolific rodents being highly recommended for his purpose both broiled and stewed with a blade of mace and a pod or two of capsicum chillies	8.778013135972484
After this homily which he delivered with much warmth of asseveration Mr Mulligan in a trice put off from his hat a kerchief with which he had shielded it	46.415888336127786
They both it seems had been overtaken by the rain and for all their mending their pace had taken water as might be observed by Mr Mulligan s smallclothes of a hodden grey which was now somewhat piebald	19.14481976169958
His project meanwhile was very favourably entertained by his auditors and won hearty eulogies from all though Mr Dixon of Mary s excepted to it asking with a finicking air did he purpose also to carry coals to Newcastle	17.782794100389232
Mr Mulligan however made court to the scholarly by an apt quotation from the classics which as it dwelt upon his memory seemed to him a sound and tasteful support of his contention ac tanta depravatio hujus seculi O quirites ut matresfamiliarum nostrae lascivas cujuslibet semiviri libici titillationes testibus ponderosis atque excelsis erectionibus centurionum Romanorum magnopere while for those of ruder wit he drove home his point by analogies of the animal kingdom more suitable to their stomach the buck and doe of the forest glade the farmyard drake and duck	3.495250132675474
Valuing himself not a little upon his elegance being indeed a proper man of person this talkative now applied himself to his dress with animadversions of some heat upon the sudden whimsy of the atmospherics while the company lavished their encomiums upon the project he had advanced	11.006941712522094
The young gentleman his friend overjoyed as he was at a passage that had late befallen him could not forbear to tell it his nearest neighbour	71.09709432312432
Mr Mulligan now perceiving the table asked for whom were those loaves and fishes and seeing the stranger he made him a civil bow and said Pray sir was you in need of any professional assistance we could give	17.782794100389232
Who upon his offer thanked him very heartily though preserving his proper distance and replied that he was come there about a lady now an inmate of Horne s house that was in an interesting condition poor body from woman s woe and here he fetched a deep sigh to know if her happiness had yet taken place	7.038135554931555
Mr Dixon to turn the table took on to ask of Mr Mulligan himself whether his incipient ventripotence upon which he rallied him betokened an ovoblastic gestation in the prostatic utricle or male womb or was due as with the noted physician Mr Austin Meldon to a wolf in the stomach	9.152473108773892
For answer Mr Mulligan in a gale of laughter at his smalls smote himself bravely below the diaphragm exclaiming with an admirable droll mimic of Mother Grogan the most excellent creature of her sex though tis pity she s a trollop There s a belly that never bore a bastard	9.55855309468529
This was so happy a conceit that it renewed the storm of mirth and threw the whole room into the most violent agitations of delight	83.76776400682921
The spry rattle had run on in the same vein of mimicry but for some larum in the antechamber	236.72295514638213
Here the listener who was none other than the Scotch student a little fume of a fellow blond as tow congratulated in the liveliest fashion with the young gentleman and interrupting the narrative at a salient point having desired his visavis with a polite beck to have the obligingness to pass him a flagon of cordial waters at the same time by a questioning poise of the head a whole century of polite breeding had not achieved so nice a gesture to which was united an equivalent but contrary balance of the bottle asked the narrator as plainly as was ever done in words if he might treat him with a cup of it	2.7213387683753076
bien noble stranger said he cheerily mille	6505.277763996392
That you may and very opportunely	42894.20781220703
There wanted nothing but this cup to crown my felicity	1468.2798851874957
But gracious heaven was I left with but a crust in my wallet and a cupful of water from the well my God I would accept of them and find it in my heart to kneel down upon the ground and give thanks to the powers above for the happiness vouchsafed me by the Giver of good things	7.038135554931555
With these words he approached the goblet to his lips took a complacent draught of the cordial slicked his hair and opening his bosom out popped a locket that hung from a silk riband that very picture which he had cherished ever since her hand had wrote therein	10.481131341546856
Gazing upon those features with a world of tenderness Ah Monsieur he said had you but beheld her as I did with these eyes at that affecting instant with her dainty tucker and her new coquette cap a gift for her feastday as she told me prettily in such an artless disorder of so melting a tenderness pon my conscience even you Monsieur had been impelled by generous nature to deliver yourself wholly into the hands of such an enemy or to quit the field for ever	3.6998304144069647
I declare I was never so touched in all my life	1852.2516943159696
God I thank thee as the Author of my days	2144.6267603638175
Thrice happy will he be whom so amiable a creature will bless with her favours	228.51838545752494
A sigh of affection gave eloquence to these words and having replaced the locket in his bosom he wiped his eye and sighed again	100.00000000000001
Beneficent Disseminator of blessings to all Thy creatures how great and universal must be that sweetest of Thy tyrannies which can hold in thrall the free and the bond the simple swain and the polished coxcomb the lover in the heyday of reckless passion and the husband of maturer years	9.55855309468529

My dear Kitty told me today that she would dance in a deluge before ever she would starve in such an ark of salvation for as she reminded me blushing piquantly and whispering in my ear though there was none to snap her words but giddy butterflies dame Nature by the divine blessing has implanted it in our hearts and it has become a household word that y a deux for which the innocence of our original garb in other circumstances a breach of the proprieties is the fittest nay the only garment	3.4034148825183075
But at this point a bell tinkling in the hall cut short a discourse which promised so bravely for the enrichment of our store of knowledge	71.09709432312432
Amid the general vacant hilarity of the assembly a bell rang and while all were conjecturing what might be the cause Miss Callan entered and having spoken a few words in a low tone to young Mr Dixon retired with a profound bow to the company	11.583232862547103
The presence even for a moment among a party of debauchees of a woman endued with every quality of modesty and not less severe than beautiful refrained the humourous sallies even of the most licentious but her departure was the signal for an outbreak of ribaldry	11.583232862547103

The young surgeon however rose and begged the company to excuse his retreat as the nurse had just then informed him that he was needed in the ward	52.983169062837085
Merciful providence had been pleased to put a period to the sufferings of the lady who was which she had borne with a laudable fortitude and she had given birth to a bouncing boy	26.826957952797255

How young she was and radiant Lalage were scarce fair beside her in her yellow shoes and frock of muslin I do not know the right name of it	46.415888336127786

During the past four minutes or thereabouts he had been staring hard at a certain amount of number one Bass bottled by Messrs Bass and Co at Burton on Trent which happened to be situated amongst a lot of others right opposite to where he was and which was certainly calculated to attract anyone s remark on account of its scarlet appearance	6.218001087320917

Eventually however both their eyes met and as soon as it began to dawn on him that the other was endeavouring to help himself to the thing he involuntarily determined to help him himself and so he accordingly took hold of the neck of the mediumsized glass recipient which contained the fluid sought after and made a capacious hole in it by pouring a lot of it out with also at the same time however a considerable degree of attentiveness in order not to upset any of the beer that was in it about the place	3.2769055017089728

Lastly at the head of the board was the young poet who found a refuge from his labours of pedagogy and metaphysical inquisition in the convivial atmosphere of Socratic discussion while to right and left of him were accommodated the flippant prognosticator fresh from the hippodrome and that vigilant wanderer soiled by the dust of travel and combat and stained by the mire of an indelible dishonour but from whose steadfast and constant heart no lure or peril or threat or degradation could ever efface the image of that voluptuous loveliness which the inspired pencil of Lafayette has limned for ages yet to come	2.99357729472049

Must we accept the view of Empedocles of Trinacria that the right ovary the postmenstrual period assert others is responsible for the birth of males or are the too long neglected spermatozoa or nemasperms the differentiating factors or is it as most embryologists incline to opine such as Culpepper Spallanzani Blumenbach Lusk Hertwig Leopold and Valenti a mixture of both	6.601948484081891

Nature we may rest assured has her own good and cogent reasons for whatever she does and in all probability such deaths are due to some law of anticipation by which organisms in which morbous germs have taken up their residence modern science has conclusively shown that only the plasmic substance can be said to be immortal tend to disappear at an increasingly earlier stage of development an arrangement which though productive of pain to some of our feelings notably the maternal is nevertheless some of us think in the long run beneficial to the race in general in securing thereby the survival of the fittest	2.9328491084381394

A white lambkin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket III Preparatory to anything else Mr Bloom brushed off the greater bulk of the shavings and handed Stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up generally in orthodox Samaritan fashion which he very badly needed	12.216773489967919
His Stephen s mind was not exactly what you would call wandering but a bit unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink Mr Bloom in view of the hour it was and there being no pump of Vartry water available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an expedient by suggesting off the reel the propriety of the cabman s shelter as it was called hardly a stonesthrow away near Butt bridge where they might hit upon some drinkables in the shape of a milk and soda or a mineral	3.2769055017089728
But how to get there was the rub	12929.441429629644
For the nonce he was rather nonplussed but inasmuch as the duty plainly devolved upon him to take some measures on the subject he pondered suitable ways and means during which Stephen repeatedly yawned	26.826957952797255
So far as he could see he was rather pale in the face so that it occurred to him as highly advisable to get a conveyance of some description which would answer in their then condition both of them being e d ed particularly Stephen always assuming that there was such a thing to be found	7.53690398089854
Accordingly after a few such preliminaries as brushing in spite of his having forgotten to take up his rather soapsuddy handkerchief after it had done yeoman service in the shaving line they both walked together along Beaver street or more properly lane as far as the farrier s and the distinctly fetid atmosphere of the livery stables at the corner of Montgomery street where they made tracks to the left from thence debouching into Amiens street round by the corner of Dan Bergin s	3.874675120456131
But as he confidently anticipated there was not a sign of a Jehu plying for hire anywhere to be seen except a fourwheeler probably engaged by some fellows inside on the spree outside the North Star hotel and there was no symptom of its budging a quarter of an inch when Mr Bloom who was anything but a professional whistler endeavoured to hail it by emitting a kind of a whistle holding his arms arched over his head twice	4.216965034285823
This was a quandary but bringing common sense to bear on it evidently there was nothing for it but put a good face on the matter and foot it which they accordingly did	29.552092352028872
So bevelling around by Mullett s and the Signal House which they shortly reached they proceeded perforce in the direction of Amiens street railway terminus Mr Bloom being handicapped by the circumstance that one of the back buttons of his trousers had to vary the timehonoured adage gone the way of all buttons though entering thoroughly into the spirit of the thing he heroically made light of the mischance	5.179474679231211
So as neither of them were particularly pressed for time as it happened and the temperature refreshing since it cleared up after the recent visitation of Jupiter Pluvius they dandered along past by where the empty vehicle was waiting without a fare or a jarvey	12.216773489967919
As it so happened a Dublin United Tramways Company s sandstrewer happened to be returning and the elder man recounted to his companion of the incident his own truly miraculous escape of some little while back	22.456979955397745
They passed the main entrance of the Great Northern railway station the starting point for Belfast where of course all traffic was suspended at that late hour and passing the backdoor of the morgue a not very enticing locality not to say gruesome to a degree more especially at night ultimately gained the Dock Tavern and in due course turned into Store street famous for its C division police station	5.0608719869196825
Between this point and the high at present unlit warehouses of Beresford place Stephen thought to think of Ibsen associated with Baird s the stonecutter s in his mind somehow in Talbot place first turning on the right while the other who was acting as his inhaled with internal satisfaction the smell of James Rourke s city bakery situated quite close to where they were the very palatable odour indeed of our daily bread of all commodities of the public the primary and most indispensable	3.814128748283214
Bread the staff of life earn your bread O tell me where is fancy bread at Rourke s the baker s it is said	92.25728693436169
to his taciturn and not to put too fine a point on it not yet perfectly sober companion Mr Bloom who at all events was in complete possession of his faculties never more so in fact disgustingly sober spoke a word of caution the dangers of nighttown women of ill fame and swell mobsmen which barely permissible once in a while though not as a habitual practice was of the nature of a regular deathtrap for young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking habits under the influence of liquor unless you knew a little jiujitsu for every contingency as even a fellow on the broad of his back could administer a nasty kick if you didn t look out	2.5306134179675253
Highly providential was the appearance on the scene of Corny Kelleher when Stephen was blissfully unconscious but for that man in the gap turning up at the eleventh hour the finis might have been that he might have been a candidate for the accident ward or failing that the bridewell and an appearance in the court next day before Mr Tobias or he being the solicitor rather old Wall he meant to say or Mahony which simply spelt ruin for a chap when it got bruited about	3.6998304144069647
The reason he mentioned the fact was that a lot of those policemen whom he cordially disliked were admittedly unscrupulous in the service of the Crown and as Mr Bloom put it recalling a case or two in the A division in Clanbrassil street prepared to swear a hole through a ten gallon pot	8.11130830789687
Never on the spot when wanted but in quiet parts of the city Pembroke road for example the guardians of the law were well in evidence the obvious reason being they were paid to protect the upper classes	19.14481976169958
Another thing he commented on was equipping soldiers with firearms or sidearms of any description liable to go off at any time which was tantamount to inciting them against civilians should by any chance they fall out over anything	17.782794100389232
You frittered away your time he very sensibly maintained and health and also character besides which the squandermania of the thing fast women of the ran away with a lot of	36.51741272548377

into the bargain and the greatest danger of all was who you got drunk with though touching the much vexed question of stimulants he relished a glass of choice old wine in season as both nourishing and bloodmaking and possessing aperient virtues notably a good burgundy which he was a staunch believer in still never beyond a certain point where he invariably drew the line as it simply led to trouble all round to say nothing of your being at the tender mercy of others practically	3.75588809068008
Most of all he commented adversely on the desertion of Stephen by all his pubhunting but one a most glaring piece of ratting on the part of his brother medicos under all the circs	26.826957952797255
And that one was Judas Stephen said who up to then had said nothing whatsoever of any kind	320.90920550935726
Discussing these and kindred topics they made a beeline across the back of the Customhouse and passed under the Loop Line bridge where a brazier of coke burning in front of a sentrybox or something like one attracted their rather lagging footsteps	14.547578108480476
Stephen of his own accord stopped for no special reason to look at the heap of barren cobblestones and by the light emanating from the brazier he could just make out the darker figure of the corporation watchman inside the gloom of the sentrybox	12.91549665014884
He began to remember that this had happened or had been mentioned as having happened before but it cost him no small effort before he remembered that he recognised in the sentry a friend of his father s Gumley	17.782794100389232
To avoid a meeting he drew nearer to the pillars of the railway bridge	723.0912169759941
Someone saluted you Mr Bloom said	16684.69320264446
A figure of middle height on the prowl evidently under the arches saluted again calling Night	320.19087738037626
Stephen of course started rather dizzily and stopped to return the compliment	828.7958165770879
Mr Bloom actuated by motives of inherent delicacy inasmuch as he always believed in minding his own business moved off but nevertheless remained on the with just a shade of anxiety though not funkyish in the least	20.691380811147894
Though unusual in the Dublin area he knew that it was not by any means unknown for desperadoes who had next to nothing to live on to be abroad waylaying and generally terrorising peaceable pedestrians by placing a pistol at their head in some secluded spot outside the city proper famished loiterers of the Thames embankment category they might be hanging about there or simply marauders ready to decamp with whatever boodle they could in one fell swoop at a moment s notice your money or your life leaving you there to point a moral gagged and garrotted	3.1992671377973836
Stephen that is when the accosting figure came to close quarters though he was not in an over sober state himself recognised Corley s breath redolent of rotten cornjuice	46.415888336127786
Lord John Corley some called him and his genealogy came about in this wise	578.6344477789381
He was the eldest son of inspector Corley of the G division lately deceased who had married a certain Katherine Brophy the daughter of a Louth farmer	61.05402296585327
His grandfather Patrick Michael Corley of New Ross had married the widow of a publican there whose maiden name had been Katherine also Talbot	90.46105730829929
Rumour had it though not proved that she descended from the house of the lords Talbot de Malahide in whose mansion really an unquestionably fine residence of its kind and well worth seeing her mother or aunt or some relative a woman as the tale went of extreme beauty had enjoyed the distinction of being in service in the washkitchen	6.601948484081891
This therefore was the reason why the still comparatively young though dissolute man who now addressed Stephen was spoken of by some with facetious proclivities as Lord John Corley	46.415888336127786
Taking Stephen on one side he had the customary doleful ditty to tell	453.4808108948786
Not as much as a farthing to purchase a night s lodgings	946.477237364379
His friends had all deserted him	26071.80446646691
Furthermore he had a row with Lenehan and called him to Stephen a mean bloody swab with a sprinkling of a number of other uncalledfor expressions	71.09709432312432
He was out of a job and implored of Stephen to tell him where on God s earth he could get something anything at all to do	61.05402296585327
No it was the daughter of the mother in the washkitchen that was fostersister to the heir of the house or else they were connected through the mother in some way both occurrences happening at the same time if the whole thing wasn t a complete fabrication from start to finish	9.152473108773892
I wouldn t ask you only pursued he on my solemn oath and God knows I m on the rocks	202.21866849346097
There ll be a job tomorrow or next day Stephen told him in a boys school at Dalkey for a gentleman usher	149.24955450518294
Mr Garrett Deasy	10747926.232809989
You may mention my name	99342.90258232967
Ah God Corley replied sure I couldn t teach in a school man	583.9918933518449
I was never one of your bright ones he added with a half laugh	899.0256235996372
I got stuck twice in the junior at the christian brothers	2547.128688054572
I have no place to sleep myself Stephen informed him	1863.0267770843761
Corley at the first go off was inclined to suspect it was something to do with Stephen being fired out of his digs for bringing in a bloody tart off the street	32.74549162877729
There was a dosshouse in Marlborough street Mrs Maloney s but it was only a tanner touch and full of undesirables but M Conachie told him you got a decent enough do in the Brazen Head over in Winetavern street which was distantly suggestive to the person addressed of friar Bacon for a bob	8.11130830789687
He was starving too though he hadn t said a word about it	702.5880270959585
Though this sort of thing went on every other night or very near it still Stephen s feelings got the better of him in a sense though he knew that Corley s brandnew rigmarole on a par with the others was hardly deserving of much credence	11.583232862547103
However ignarus malorum miseris succurrere disco as the Latin poet remarks especially as luck would have it he got paid his screw after every middle of the month on the sixteenth which was the date of the month as a matter of fact though a good bit of the wherewithal was demolished	8.778013135972484
But the cream of the joke was nothing would get it out of Corley s head that he was living in affluence and hadn t a thing to do but hand out the needful	26.826957952797255
Whereas	3162277660168.3784
He put his hand in a pocket anyhow not with the idea of finding any food there but thinking he might lend him anything up to a bob or so in lieu so that he might endeavour at all events and get sufficient to eat but the result was in the negative for to his chagrin he found his cash missing	6.40400427119728
A few broken biscuits were all the result of his investigation	2246.633782105479
He tried his hardest to recollect for the moment whether he had lost as well he might have or left because in that contingency it was not a pleasant lookout very much the reverse in fact	22.456979955397745
He was altogether too fagged out to institute a thorough search though he tried to recollect	277.9696542280635
About biscuits he dimly remembered	49273.35564184172
Who now exactly gave them he wondered or where was or did he buy	514.5074336365909
However in another pocket he came across what he surmised in the dark were pennies erroneously however as it turned out	147.58383814486083
Those are halfcrowns man Corley corrected him	5179.528880767283
And so in point of fact they turned out to be	1355.5632245184172
Stephen anyhow lent him one of them	16705.624589968167
Thanks Corley answered you re a gentleman	9521.68628786722
I ll pay you back one time	11943.588545301724
I saw him a few times in the Bleeding Horse in Camden street with Boylan the billsticker	320.8311197909911
You might put in a good word for us to get me taken on there	633.5752606893344

I don t give a shite anyway so long as I get a job even as a crossing sweeper	242.37191278386496
Subsequently being not quite so down in the mouth after the two and six he got he informed Stephen about a fellow by the name of Bags Comisky that he said Stephen knew well out of Fullam s the shipchandler s bookkeeper there that used to be often round in Nagle s back with O Mara and a little chap with a stutter the name of Tighe	5.4361836201538365
Anyhow he was lagged the night before last and fined ten bob for a drunk and disorderly and refusing to go with the constable	100.00000000000001
Mr Bloom in the meanwhile kept dodging about in the vicinity of the cobblestones near the brazier of coke in front of the corporation watchman s sentrybox who evidently a glutton for work it struck him was having a quiet forty winks for all intents and purposes on his own private account while Dublin slept	7.813707376518094
Being a levelheaded individual who could give points to not a few in point of shrewd observation he also remarked on his very dilapidated hat and slouchy wearing apparel generally testifying to a chronic impecuniosity	24.484367468222267
Palpably he was one of his hangerson but for the matter of that it was merely a question of one preying on his nextdoor neighbour all round in every deep so to put it a deeper depth and for the matter of that if the man in the street chanced to be in the dock himself penal servitude with or without the option of a fine would be a very altogether	4.948168092155143
In any case he had a consummate amount of cool assurance intercepting people at that hour of the night or morning	174.7901074700682
Pretty thick that was certainly	108434.3966094766
The pair parted company and Stephen rejoined Mr Bloom who with his practised eye was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the blandiloquence of the other parasite	46.415888336127786
Alluding to the encounter he said laughingly Stephen that is He is down on his luck	482.3075352788591
He asked me to ask you to ask somebody named Boylan a billsticker to give him a job as a sandwichman	187.38174228603845
At this intelligence in which he seemingly evinced little interest Mr Bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the direction of a bucketdredger rejoicing in the farfamed name of Eblana moored alongside Customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair whereupon he observed evasively Everybody gets their own ration of luck they say	6.601948484081891
Now you mention it his face was familiar to me	1883.4338483718059
But leaving that for the moment how much did you part with he queried if I am not too inquisitive	237.14146463205975
Half a crown Stephen responded	78711.65021233888
I daresay he needs it to sleep somewhere	7561.241296783051
Mr Bloom ejaculated professing not the least surprise at the intelligence I can quite credit the assertion and I guarantee he invariably does	117.3102444002054
Everyone according to his needs or everyone according to his deeds	1263.288928101088
But talking about things in general where added he with a smile will you sleep yourself	448.6542943992016
Walking to Sandycove is out of the question	5005.75734055689
And even supposing you did you won t get in after what occurred at Westland Row station	291.6736479654205
Simply fag out there for nothing	23466.969204532208
I don t mean to presume to dictate to you in the slightest degree but why did you leave your father s house	121.15276586285881
To seek misfortune was Stephen s answer	12033.114292151284
I met your respected father on a recent occasion Mr Bloom diplomatically returned today in fact or to be strictly accurate on yesterday	121.15276586285881
Where does he live at present	25131.71548923353
I gathered in the course of conversation that he had moved	2606.262436038744
I believe he is in Dublin somewhere Stephen answered unconcernedly	3801.4073909010003
Why	3162277660168.3784
A gifted man Mr Bloom said of Mr Dedalus senior in more respects than one and a born if ever there was one	121.15276586285881
He takes great pride quite legitimate out of you	3043.7095168444766
You could go back perhaps he hasarded still thinking of the very unpleasant scene at Westland Row terminus when it was perfectly evident that the other two Mulligan that is and that English tourist friend of his who eventually euchred their third companion were patently trying as if the whole bally station belonged to them to give Stephen the slip in the confusion which they did	5.575305334261898
There was no response forthcoming to the suggestion however such as it was Stephen s mind s eye being too busily engaged in repicturing his family hearth the last time he saw it with his sister Dilly sitting by the ingle her hair hanging down waiting for some weak Trinidad shell cocoa that was in the sootcoated kettle to be done so that she and he could drink it with the oatmealwater for milk after the Friday herrings they had eaten at two a penny with an egg apiece for Maggy Boody and Katey the cat meanwhile under the mangle devouring a mess of eggshells and charred fish heads and bones on a square of brown paper in accordance with the third precept of the church to fast and abstain on the days commanded it being quarter tense or if not ember days or something like that	2.176896784350984
No Mr Bloom repeated again I wouldn t personally repose much trust in that boon companion of yours who contributes the humorous element Dr Mulligan as a guide philosopher and friend if I were in your shoes	20.691380811147894
He knows which side his bread is buttered on though in all probability he never realised what it is to be without regular meals	100.00000000000001
Of course you didn t notice as much as I did	1189.3824096259693
But it wouldn t occasion me the least surprise to learn that a pinch of tobacco or some narcotic was put in your drink for some ulterior object	52.983169062837085
He understood however from all he heard that Dr Mulligan was a versatile allround man by no means confined to medicine only who was rapidly coming to the fore in his line and if the report was verified bade fair to enjoy a flourishing practice in the not too distant future as a tony medical practitioner drawing a handsome fee for his services in addition to which professional status his rescue of that man from certain drowning by artificial respiration and what they call first aid at Skerries or Malahide was it was he was bound to admit an exceedingly plucky deed which he could not too highly praise so that frankly he was utterly at a loss to fathom what earthly reason could be at the back of it except he put it down to sheer cussedness or jealousy pure and simple	2.224447817359432
Except it simply amounts to one thing and he is what they call picking your brains he ventured to throw out	169.26939039458486
The guarded glance of half solicitude half curiosity augmented by friendliness which he gave at Stephen s at present morose expression of features did not throw a flood of light none at all in fact on the problem as to whether he had let himself be badly bamboozled to judge by two or three lowspirited remarks he let drop or the other way about saw through the affair and for some reason or other best known to himself allowed matters to more or less	3.874675120456131
Adjacent to the men s public urinal they perceived an icecream car round which a group of presumably Italians in heated altercation were getting rid of voluble expressions in their vivacious language in a particularly animated way there being some little differences between the parties	12.216773489967919

Cinque la testa più Mr Bloom and Stephen entered the cabman s shelter an unpretentious wooden structure where prior to then he had rarely if ever been before the former having previously whispered to the latter a few hints anent the keeper of it said to be the once famous Skin the Goat Fitzharris the invincible though he could not vouch for the actual facts which quite possibly there was not one vestige of truth in	4.460162165376301
A few moments later saw our two noctambules safely seated in a discreet corner only to be greeted by stares from the decidedly miscellaneous collection of waifs and strays and other nondescript specimens of the genus already there engaged in eating and drinking diversified by conversation for whom they seemingly formed an object of marked curiosity	7.53690398089854
Now touching a cup of coffee Mr Bloom ventured to plausibly suggest to break the ice it occurs to me you ought to sample something in the shape of solid food say a roll of some description	20.691380811147894
Accordingly his first act was with characteristic to order these commodities quietly	482.21683964625265
Mr Bloom availing himself of the right of free speech he having just a bowing acquaintance with the language in dispute though to be sure rather in a quandary over remarked to his in an audible tone of voice of the battle royal in the street which was still raging fast and furious A beautiful language	7.53690398089854

Mr Bloom asked	9378146.915657314
Of course he subjoined pensively at the inward reflection of there being more languages to start with than were absolutely necessary it may be only the southern glamour that surrounds it	36.51741272548377
After which he beat a retreat to his counter Mr Bloom determining to have a good square look at him later on so as not to appear to	52.983169062837085
For which reason he encouraged Stephen to proceed with his eyes while he did the honours by surreptitiously pushing the cup of what was temporarily supposed to be called coffee gradually nearer him	29.552092352028872
Sounds are impostures Stephen said after a pause of some little time like names	434.2919715571036
Cicero Podmore Napoleon Mr Goodbody	35687.858336670506
Jesus Mr Doyle	8604070.16858872
Shakespeares were as common as Murphies	14618.441672354165
What s in a name	207191.51237982372
Yes to be sure Mr Bloom unaffectedly concurred	9549.741090622327
Of course	419667764.0506416
Our name was changed too he added pushing the socalled roll across	637.4841741941918
The redbearded sailor who had his weather eye on the newcomers boarded Stephen whom he had singled out for attention in particular squarely by asking And what might your name be	36.51741272548377
Just in the nick of time Mr Bloom touched his companion s boot but Stephen apparently disregarding the warm pressure from an unexpected quarter answered Dedalus	71.09709432312432
The sailor stared at him heavily from a pair of drowsy baggy eyes rather bunged up from excessive use of boose preferably good old Hollands and water	61.05402296585327
You know Simon Dedalus	677381.450025908
he asked at length	1122214.1759504736
I ve heard of him Stephen said	19312.649558493926
Mr Bloom was all at sea for a moment seeing the others evidently eavesdropping too	540.0403832169923
He s Irish the seaman bold affirmed staring still in much the same way and nodding	324.5273507572901
All Irish	1742450348.0977805
All too Irish Stephen rejoined	94129.40750579661
As for Mr Bloom he could neither make head or tail of the whole business and he was just asking himself what possible connection when the sailor of his own accord turned to the other occupants of the shelter with the remark I seen him shoot two eggs off two bottles at fifty yards over his shoulder	7.2789538439831505
The lefthand dead shot	799971.2833503492
Though he was slightly hampered by an occasional stammer and his gestures being also clumsy as it was still he did his best to explain	83.76776400682921
Bottles out there say	368241.66019815917
Fifty yards measured	3266521.372310533
Eggs on the bottles	904245.9825715431
Cocks his gun over his shoulder	12808.410595557441
Aims	3162277660168.3784
He turned his body half round shut up his right eye completely	1018.9454007806472
Then he screwed his features up someway sideways and glared out into the night with an unprepossessing cast of countenance	144.95958678339787
Pom	3162277660168.3784
he then shouted once	1141594.1748977143
The entire audience waited anticipating an additional detonation there being still a further egg	311.94466421905486
Pom	3162277660168.3784
he shouted twice	24081348.93355305
Egg two evidently demolished he nodded and winked adding bloodthirstily Buffalo Bill shoots to kill Never missed nor he never will A silence ensued till Mr Bloom for agreeableness sake just felt like asking him whether it was for a marksmanship competition like the Bisley	12.216773489967919
Long ago	668090073.7856135
Mr Bloom pursued without flinching a hairsbreadth	8272.284523109916
Why the sailor replied relaxing to a certain extent under the magic influence of diamond cut diamond it might be a matter of ten years	83.76776400682921
He toured the wide world with Hengler s Royal Circus	1406.163765853753
I seen him do that in Stockholm	26552.164859569275
Curious coincidence Mr Bloom confided to Stephen unobtrusively	4918.518792362516

She s my own true wife I haven t seen for seven years now sailing about	262.9419065092934
Mr Bloom could easily picture his advent on this scene the homecoming to the mariner s roadside shieling after having diddled Davy Jones a rainy night with a blind moon	41.011270705513006
Across the world for a wife	34086.420798851876
Quite a number of stories there were on that particular Alice Ben Bolt topic Enoch Arden and Rip van Winkle and does anybody hereabouts remember Caoc O Leary a favourite and most trying declamation piece by the way of poor John Casey and a bit of perfect poetry in its own small way	8.431909292866257
Never about the runaway wife coming back however much devoted to the absentee	704.2556259389086
The face at the window	257290.7730046665
Judge of his astonishment when he finally did breast the tape and the awful truth dawned upon him anent his better half wrecked in his affections	71.09709432312432
There she sits a grasswidow at the selfsame fireside	2898.7136742588555

The sailor who scarcely seemed to be a Dublin resident turned to one of the jarvies with the request You don t happen to have such a thing as a spare chaw about you	26.826957952797255
The jarvey addressed as it happened had not but the keeper took a die of plug from his good jacket hanging on a nail and the desired object was passed from hand to hand	26.826957952797255
Thank you the sailor said	123221.14186055424
He deposited the quid in his gob and chewing and with some slow stammers proceeded We come up this morning eleven o clock	120.88826329968124

In confirmation of which statement he extricated from an inside pocket and handed to his neighbour a not very cleanlooking folded document	127.46408519753979
You must have seen a fair share of the world the keeper remarked leaning on the counter	384.8563470987168
Why the sailor answered upon reflection upon it I ve circumnavigated a bit since I first joined on	202.6490122088582
I was in the Red Sea	53701.11791805711
We was chased by pirates one voyage	6998.59058602594
I seen icebergs plenty growlers	128611.68978503383
I was in Stockholm and the Black Sea the Dardanelles under Captain Dalton the best bloody man that ever scuttled a ship	131.057050341788
I seen Russia	24289243.207405113

That s how the Russians prays	32414.45259411124
You seen queer sights don t be talking put in a jarvey	1178.8044021788821
Why the sailor said shifting his partially chewed plug	1737.363337347145
I seen queer things too ups and downs	5314.638153219
I seen a crocodile bite the fluke of an anchor same as I chew that quid	315.1964698231046
He took out of his mouth the pulpy quid and lodging it between his teeth bit ferociously Khaan	211.96405470758404
Like that	545884694.9195335
And I seen maneaters in Peru that eats corpses and the livers of horses	408.919754033197
Look here	868843352.9792744
Here they are	10012925.846671777
A friend of mine sent me	37433.20381854531
He fumbled out a picture postcard from his inside pocket which seemed to be in its way a species of repository and pushed it along the table	61.05402296585327
The printed matter on it stated de Indios	7083.452990985869
Beni Bolivia All focussed their attention at the scene exhibited a group of savage women in striped loincloths squatted blinking suckling frowning sleeping amid a swarm of infants there must have been quite a score of them outside some primitive shanties of osier	13.68874509537081

See them sitting there stark ballocknaked eating a dead horse s liver raw	402.731683714885
His postcard proved a centre of attraction for Messrs the greenhorns for several minutes if not more	150.51083258400806
Know how to keep them off	35606.90877171915
he inquired generally	22853779.75992318
Nobody volunteering a statement he winked saying Glass	2219.6319865555256
That boggles em	11464808.561259871
Glass	3162277660168.3784
Mr Bloom without evincing surprise unostentatiously turned over the card to peruse the partially obliterated address and postmark	148.67790677519085
It ran as follows Postal Señor A Boudin Galeria Becche Santiago Chile There was no message evidently as he took particular notice	84.41250119439724
Though not an implicit believer in the lurid story narrated or the eggsniping transaction for that matter despite William Tell and the Lazarillo Don Cesar de Bazan incident depicted in on which occasion the former s ball passed through the latter s hat having detected a discrepancy between his name assuming he was the person he represented himself to be and not sailing under false colours after having boxed the compass on the strict q t	4.460162165376301
somewhere and the fictitious addressee of the missive which made him nourish some suspicions of our friend s nevertheless it reminded him in a way of a longcherished plan he meant to one day realise some Wednesday or Saturday of travelling to London long sea not to say that he had ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained a landlubber except you call going to Holyhead which was his longest	3.6458412370707323
Martin Cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through Egan but some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that the scheme fell through	46.415888336127786
But even suppose it did come to planking down the needful and breaking Boyd s heart it was not so dear purse permitting a few guineas at the outside considering the fare to Mullingar where he figured on going was five and six there and back	11.583232862547103
The trip would benefit health on account of the bracing ozone and be in every way thoroughly pleasurable especially for a chap whose liver was out of order seeing the different places along the route Plymouth Falmouth Southampton and so on culminating in an instructive tour of the sights of the great metropolis the spectacle of our modern Babylon where doubtless he would see the greatest improvement tower abbey wealth of Park lane to renew acquaintance with	4.3754793750741845
Another thing just struck him as a by no means bad notion was he might have a gaze around on the spot to see about trying to make arrangements about a concert tour of summer music embracing the most prominent pleasure resorts Margate with mixed bathing and firstrate hydros and spas Eastbourne Scarborough Margate and so on beautiful Bournemouth the Channel islands and similar bijou spots which might prove highly remunerative	4.948168092155143
Not of course with a hole and corner scratch company or local ladies on the job witness Mrs C P M Coy type lend me your valise and I ll post you the ticket	26.826957952797255
No something top notch an all star Irish caste the Tweedy Flower grand opera company with his own legal consort as leading lady as a sort of counterblast to the Elster Grimes and Moody Manners perfectly simple matter and he was quite sanguine of success providing puffs in the local papers could be managed by some fellow with a bit of bounce who could pull the indispensable wires and thus combine business with pleasure	4.641588833612779
But who	1561589224.1825833
That was the rub	1068975.3834389
Also without being actually positive it struck him a great field was to be opened up in the line of opening up new routes to keep pace with the times of the Fishguard Rosslare route which it was mooted was once more on the in the circumlocution departments with the usual quantity of red tape and dillydallying of effete fogeydom and dunderheads generally	6.042963902381328
A great opportunity there certainly was for push and enterprise to meet the travelling needs of the public at large the average man i e	75.83067826366776
Brown Robinson and Co	313816.7685958881
It was a subject of regret and absurd as well on the face of it and no small blame to our vaunted society that the man in the street when the system really needed toning up for the matter of a couple of paltry pounds was debarred from seeing more of the world they lived in instead of being always and ever cooped up since my old stick in the mud took me for a wife	4.460162165376301
After all hang it they had their eleven and more humdrum months of it and merited a radical change of after the grind of city life in the summertime for choice when dame Nature is at her spectacular best constituting nothing short of a new lease of life	10.481131341546856
There were equally excellent opportunities for vacationists in the home island delightful sylvan spots for rejuvenation offering a plethora of attractions as well as a bracing tonic for the system in and around Dublin and its picturesque environs even Poulaphouca to which there was a steamtram but also farther away from the madding crowd in Wicklow rightly termed the garden of Ireland an ideal neighbourhood for elderly wheelmen so long as it didn t come down and in the wilds of Donegal where if report spoke true the d was exceedingly grand though the lastnamed locality was not easily getatable so that the influx of visitors was not as yet all that it might be considering the signal benefits to be derived from it while Howth with its historic associations and otherwise Silken Thomas Grace O Malley George IV rhododendrons several hundred feet above sealevel was a favourite haunt with all sorts and conditions of men especially in the spring when young men s fancy though it had its own toll of deaths by falling off the cliffs by design or accidentally usually by the way on their left leg it being only about three quarters of an hour s run from the pillar	1.7534865500829584
Because of course uptodate tourist travelling was as yet merely in its infancy so to speak and the accommodation left much to be desired	100.00000000000001
Interesting to fathom it seemed to him from a motive of curiosity pure and simple was whether it was the traffic that created the route or viceversa or the two sides in fact	29.552092352028872
He turned back the other side of the card picture and passed it along to Stephen	476.2325671531169
I seen a Chinese one time related the doughty narrator that had little pills like putty and he put them in the water and they opened and every pill was something different	32.74549162877729

Possibly perceiving an expression of dubiosity on their faces the globetrotter went on adhering to his adventures	181.78014465723874
And I seen a man killed in Trieste by an Italian chap	1128.3706322310215
Knife in his back	668517.7562109862
Knife like that	4606801.3743261015
Whilst speaking he produced a dangerouslooking claspknife quite in keeping with his character and held it in the striking position	122.81649986837157
In a knockingshop it was count of a tryon between two smugglers	1056.8242749131823

Chuk	3162277660168.3784
His heavy glance drowsily roaming about kind of defied their further questions even should they by any chance want to	93.7904435463827
After which harrowing sufficient to appal the stoutest he snapped the blade to and stowed the weapon in question away as before in his chamber of horrors otherwise pocket	46.415888336127786
They re great for the cold steel somebody who was evidently quite in the dark said for the benefit of them all	149.24955450518294
That was why they thought the park murders of the invincibles was done by foreigners on account of them using knives	187.38174228603845
At this remark passed obviously in the spirit of ignorance is Mr B	562.9641292679463
and Stephen each in his own particular way both instinctively exchanged meaning glances in a religious silence of the strictly variety however towards where Skin the Goat the keeper not turning a hair was drawing spurts of liquid from his boiler affair	14.547578108480476
His inscrutable face which was really a work of art a perfect study in itself beggaring description conveyed the impression that he didn t understand one jot of what was going on	32.74549162877729
Funny very	593211608.7966315
There ensued a somewhat lengthy pause	20500.10747591791
One man was reading in fits and starts a stained by coffee evening journal another the card with the natives another the seaman s discharge	79.14453703212779
Mr Bloom so far as he was personally concerned was just pondering in pensive mood	411.7456353056243
He vividly recollected when the occurrence alluded to took place as well as yesterday roughly some score of years previously in the days of the land troubles when it took the civilised world by storm figuratively speaking early in the eighties eightyone to be correct when he was just turned fifteen	9.152473108773892
Ay boss the sailor broke in	23972.520604675352
Give us back them papers	82924.20012756565
The request being complied with he clawed them up with a scrape	891.1697795500804
Have you seen the rock of Gibraltar	8261.694915310809
Mr Bloom inquired	16230497.360018918
The sailor grimaced chewing in a way that might be read as yes ay or no	338.0077400865805
Ah you ve touched there too Mr Bloom said Europa point thinking he had in the hope that the rover might possibly by some reminiscences but he failed to do so simply letting spirt a jet of spew into the sawdust and shook his head with a sort of lazy scorn	9.152473108773892
What year would that be about	38902.76910247807
Mr B interrogated	17604966.15741535
Our sailor munched heavily awhile hungrily before answering I m tired of all them rocks in the sea he said and boats and ships	100.00000000000001
Salt junk all the time	56504.62919500203
Tired seemingly he ceased	259063.70025083137
His questioner perceiving that he was not likely to get a great deal of change out of such a wily old customer fell to woolgathering on the enormous dimensions of the water about the globe suffice it to say that as a casual glance at the map revealed it covered fully three fourths of it and he fully realised accordingly what it meant to rule the waves	5.4361836201538365
On more than one occasion a dozen at the lowest near the North Bull at Dollymount he had remarked a superannuated old salt evidently derelict seated habitually near the not particularly redolent sea on the wall staring quite obliviously at it and it at him dreaming of fresh woods and pastures new as someone somewhere sings	7.53690398089854
And it left him wondering why	30346.563254374163
Possibly he had tried to find out the secret for himself floundering up and down the antipodes and all that sort of thing and over and under well not exactly under tempting the fates	26.826957952797255
And the odds were twenty to nil there was really no secret about it at all	336.66541552815335
There was a fellow sailed with me in the the old seadog himself a rover proceeded went ashore and took up a soft job as gentleman s valet at six quid a month	29.552092352028872
Them are his trousers I ve on me and he gave me an oilskin and that jackknife	360.6646623559852
I m game for that job shaving and brushup	3775.8303074540904
I hate roaming about	817089.3138244771
There s my son now Danny run off to sea and his mother got him took in a draper s in Cork where he could be drawing easy money	46.415888336127786
What age is he	799618.4855031099
queried one hearer who by the way seen from the side bore a distant resemblance to Henry Campbell the townclerk away from the carking cares of office unwashed of course and in a seedy getup and a strong suspicion of nosepaint about the nasal appendage	12.216773489967919
Why the sailor answered with a slow puzzled utterance my son Danny	881.0187037666768
He d be about eighteen now way I figure it	1969.8447048602577
The Skibbereen father hereupon tore open his grey or unclean anyhow shirt with his two hands and scratched away at his chest on which was to be seen an image tattooed in blue Chinese ink intended to represent an anchor	16.57723885589317
I must get a wash tomorrow or next day	3335.900178621821
It s them black lads I objects to	3464.3884690783225
I hate those buggers	993421.4592408359
Suck your blood dry they does	10911.960652776537
Seeing they were all looking at his chest he accommodatingly dragged his shirt more open so that on top of the timehonoured symbol of the mariner s hope and rest they had a full view of the figure and a young man s sideface looking frowningly rather	11.006941712522094
Tattoo the exhibitor explained	195908.84495565202
That was done when we were lying becalmed off Odessa in the Black Sea under Captain Dalton	244.63117908986504
Fellow the name of Antonio done that	7856.994452044608
There he is himself a Greek	39884.8053890238
Did it hurt much doing it	19608.72598162516
one asked the sailor	1104608.3754182826
That worthy however was busily engaged in collecting round the	1185.977339503326
Someway in his	3432425.614704397
Squeezing or	310118385.0482162
See here he said showing Antonio	43280.70012833622
There he is cursing the mate	29007.707815862053
And there he is now he added the same fellow pulling the skin with his fingers some special knack evidently and he laughing at a yarn	71.09709432312432
And in point of fact the young man named Antonio s livid face did actually look like forced smiling and the curious effect excited the unreserved admiration of everybody including Skin the Goat who this time stretched over	19.14481976169958
Ay ay sighed the sailor looking down on his manly chest	1174.0863917329305
He s gone too	1079539.5670451063
Ate by sharks after	242749.82255759163
He let go of the skin so that the profile resumed the normal expression of before	407.286756431809
Neat bit of work one longshoreman said	6453.919496743647
And what s the number for	72767.7820278671
Eaten alive	447262196.2410999
a third asked the sailor	197565.7853178927
Ay ay sighed again the latter personage more cheerily this time with some sort of a half smile for a brief duration only in the direction of the questioner about the number	32.74549162877729
Ate	3162277660168.3784
A Greek he was	926833.6553034277
And then he added with rather gallowsbird humour considering his alleged end As bad as old Antonio For he left me on my ownio	95.86552058241018
The face of a streetwalker glazed and haggard under a black straw hat peered askew round the door of the shelter palpably reconnoitring on her own with the object of bringing more grist to her mill	22.456979955397745
Mr Bloom scarcely knowing which way to look turned away on the moment flusterfied but outwardly calm and picking up from the table the pink sheet of the Abbey street organ which the jarvey if such he was had laid aside he picked it up and looked at the pink of the paper though why pink	7.53690398089854
His reason for so doing was he recognised on the moment round the door the same face he had caught a fleeting glimpse of that afternoon on Ormond quay the partially idiotic female namely of the lane who knew the lady in the brown costume does be with you Mrs B and begged the chance of his washing	7.038135554931555
Also why washing which seemed rather vague than not your washing	642.8839951251218
Still candour compelled him to admit he had washed his wife s undergarments when soiled in Holles street and women would and did too a man s similar garments initialled with Bewley and Draper s marking ink hers were that is if they really loved him that is to say love me love my dirty shirt	7.53690398089854
Still just then being on tenterhooks he desired the female s room more than her company so it came as a genuine relief when the keeper made her a rude sign to take herself off	24.484367468222267
Round the side of the he just caught a fleeting glimpse of her face round the side of the door with a kind of demented glassy grin showing that she was not exactly all there viewing with evident amusement the group of gazers round skipper Murphy s nautical chest and then there was no more of her	7.2789538439831505
The gunboat the keeper said	126750.23577280308
Unfortunate creature	390722099.23233885
Of course I suppose some man is ultimately responsible for her condition	819.9230392317897
Still no matter what the cause is from	6239.794657826732
Stephen had not noticed her and shrugged his shoulders merely remarking In this country people sell much more than she ever had and do a roaring trade	61.05402296585327
Fear not them that sell the body but have not power to buy the soul	281.1097089318594
She is a bad merchant	239195.85363739892
She buys dear and sells cheap	25479.97704531198
The elder man though not by any manner of means an old maid or a prude said it was nothing short of a crying scandal that ought to be put a stop to to say that women of that stamp quite apart from any oldmaidish squeamishness on the subject a necessary evil were not licensed and medically inspected by the proper authorities a thing he could truthfully state he as a was a stalwart advocate of from the very first start	4.071515547789689
You as a good catholic he observed talking of body and soul believe in the soul	487.68606652520003
Or do you mean the intelligence the brainpower as such as distinct from any outside object the table let us say that cup	116.22411949964365
I believe in that myself because it has been explained by competent men as the convolutions of the grey matter	240.40991835099712
Otherwise we would never have such inventions as X rays for instance	463.8025588316835
Do you	356350677.4394567
It would be immortal I understand but for the possibility of its annihilation by its First Cause Who from all I can hear is quite capable of adding that to the number of His other practical jokes per and per both being excluded by court etiquette	11.583232862547103
Mr Bloom thoroughly acquiesced in the general gist of this though the mystical finesse involved was a bit out of his sublunary depth still he felt bound to enter a demurrer on the head of simple promptly rejoining Simple	17.782794100389232
I shouldn t think that is the proper word	6318.142695226366
Of course I grant you to concede a point you do knock across a simple soul once in a blue moon	143.02876666215053
But what I am anxious to arrive at is it is one thing for instance to invent those rays Röntgen did or the telescope like Edison though I believe it was before his time Galileo was the man I mean and the same applies to the laws for example of a farreaching natural phenomenon such as electricity but it s a horse of quite another colour to say you believe in the existence of a supernatural God	4.3754793750741845
O that Stephen expostulated has been proved conclusively by several of the bestknown passages in Holy Writ apart from circumstantial evidence	111.52911299925482
On this knotty point however the views of the pair poles apart as they were both in schooling and everything else with the marked difference in their respective ages clashed	41.011270705513006
Has been	868843352.9792744
I m not so sure about that	13260.077493853945
That s a matter for everyman s opinion and without dragging in the sectarian side of the business I beg to differ with you there	83.76776400682921
My belief is to tell you the candid truth that those bits were genuine forgeries all of them put in by monks most probably or it s the big question of our national poet over again who precisely wrote them like and Bacon as you who know your Shakespeare infinitely better than I of course I needn t tell you	6.601948484081891
Can t you drink that coffee by the way	2747.9406143129827
Let me stir it	523507.0649692357
And take a piece of that bun	29874.579145294876
It s like one of our skipper s bricks disguised	2228.614482324063
Still no one can give what he hasn t got	2185.0816018382034
Try a bit	6503884.6070164135
Couldn t Stephen contrived to get out his mental organs for the moment refusing to dictate further	236.73221675709993
Faultfinding being a proverbially bad hat Mr Bloom thought well to stir or try to the clotted sugar from the bottom and reflected with something approaching acrimony on the Coffee Palace and its temperance and lucrative work	20.691380811147894
To be sure it was a legitimate object and beyond yea or nay did a world of good shelters such as the present one they were in run on teetotal lines for vagrants at night concerts dramatic evenings and useful lectures admittance free by qualified men for the lower orders	9.55855309468529
On the other hand he had a distinct and painful recollection they paid his wife Madam Marion Tweedy who had been prominently associated with it at one time a very modest remuneration indeed for her pianoplaying	22.456979955397745
The idea he was strongly inclined to believe was to do good and net a profit there being no competition to speak of	121.15276586285881
Anyhow inspection medical inspection of all eatables seemed to him more than ever necessary which possibly accounted for the vogue of Dr Tibble s Vi Cocoa on account of the medical analysis involved	29.552092352028872
Have a shot at it now he ventured to say of the coffee after being stirred	442.10201255930275
Thus prevailed on to at any rate taste it Stephen lifted the heavy mug from the brown puddle it clopped out of when taken up by the handle and took a sip of the offending beverage	22.456979955397745
Still it s solid food his good genius urged I m a stickler for solid food his one and only reason being not gormandising in the least but regular meals as the qua for any kind of proper work mental or manual	14.547578108480476
You ought to eat more solid food	10617.61612664011
You would feel a different man	35115.691840556145
Liquids I can eat Stephen said	18793.807059222676
But O oblige me by taking away that knife	2610.057919375305
I can t look at the point of it	5540.238555793631
It reminds me of Roman history	36657.69378875779
Mr Bloom promptly did as suggested and removed the incriminated article a blunt hornhandled ordinary knife with nothing particularly Roman or antique about it to the lay eye observing that the point was the least conspicuous point about it	17.782794100389232
Our mutual friend s stories are like himself Mr Bloom of knives remarked to his sotto	326.35952272579675
Do you think they are genuine	42172.45315706874
He could spin those yarns for hours on end all night long and lie like old boots	218.7340864864642
Look at him	6922541.283223914
Yet still though his eyes were thick with sleep and sea air life was full of a host of things and coincidences of a terrible nature and it was quite within the bounds of possibility that it was not an entire fabrication though at first blush there was not much inherent probability in all the spoof he got off his chest being strictly accurate gospel	5.722367659350217
He had been meantime taking stock of the individual in front of him and Sherlockholmesing him up ever since he clapped eyes on him	100.00000000000001
Though a wellpreserved man of no little stamina if a trifle prone to baldness there was something spurious in the cut of his jib that suggested a jail delivery and it required no violent stretch of imagination to associate such a weirdlooking specimen with the oakum and treadmill fraternity	10.0
He might even have done for his man supposing it was his own case he told as people often did about others namely that he killed him himself and had served his four or five goodlooking years in durance vile to say nothing of the Antonio personage no relation to the dramatic personage of identical name who sprang from the pen of our national poet who expiated his crimes in the melodramatic manner above described	4.548777947003777
On the other hand he might be only bluffing a pardonable weakness because meeting unmistakable mugs Dublin residents like those jarvies waiting news from abroad would tempt any ancient mariner who sailed the ocean seas to draw the long bow about the schooner and etcetera	12.216773489967919
And when all was said and done the lies a fellow told about himself couldn t probably hold a proverbial candle to the wholesale whoppers other fellows coined about him	41.011270705513006
Mind you I m not saying that it s all a pure invention he resumed	483.6865605438538
Analogous scenes are occasionally if not often met with	1501.4040625327536
Giants though that is rather a far cry you see once in a way Marcella the midget queen	179.2920503991269
In those waxworks in Henry street I myself saw some Aztecs as they are called sitting bowlegged they couldn t straighten their legs if you paid them because the muscles here you see he proceeded indicating on his companion the brief outline of the sinews or whatever you like to call them behind the right knee were utterly powerless from sitting that way so long cramped up being adored as gods	4.948168092155143
There s an example again of simple souls	5169.607857865624
However reverting to friend Sinbad and his horrifying adventures who reminded him a bit of Ludwig Ledwidge when he occupied the boards of the Gaiety when Michael Gunn was identified with the management in the a stupendous success and his host of admirers came in large numbers everyone simply flocking to hear him though ships of any sort phantom or the reverse on the stage usually fell a bit flat as also did trains there was nothing intrinsically incompatible about it he conceded	3.9376589235643866
On the contrary that stab in the back touch was quite in keeping with those italianos though candidly he was none the less free to admit those icecreamers and friers in the fish way not to mention the chip potato variety and so forth over in little Italy there near the Coombe were sober thrifty hardworking fellows except perhaps a bit too given to pothunting the harmless necessary animal of the feline persuasion of others at night so as to have a good old succulent tuckin with garlic off him or her next day on the quiet and he added on the cheap	3.0253054571024545
Spaniards for instance he continued passionate temperaments like that impetuous as Old Nick are given to taking the law into their own hands and give you your quietus doublequick with those poignards they carry in the abdomen	20.691380811147894
It comes from the great heat climate generally	8628.71907971882
My wife is so to speak Spanish half that is	1748.0653149986915
Point of fact she could actually claim Spanish nationality if she wanted having been born in technically Spain i e	112.0535865332337
Gibraltar	3162277660168.3784
Quite dark regular brunette black	53317.33663313938
I for one certainly believe climate accounts for character	2836.572075334636
That s why I asked you if you wrote your poetry in Italian	742.9027497297304
The temperaments at the door Stephen interposed with were very passionate about ten shillings	470.3983403821205
ruba roba	310118385.0482162
Quite so Mr Bloom dittoed	148700.44055542545
Then Stephen said staring and rambling on to himself or some unknown listener somewhere we have the impetuosity of Dante and the isosceles triangle miss Portinari he fell in love with and Leonardo and san Tommaso Mastino	20.691380811147894
It s in the blood Mr Bloom acceded at once	2802.294037117756
All are washed in the blood of the sun	4297.590769583577
Coincidence I just happened to be in the Kildare street museum today shortly prior to our meeting if I can so call it and I was just looking at those antique statues there	29.552092352028872
The splendid proportions of hips bosom	26975.080657143244
You simply don t knock against those kind of women here	1493.0235701918948
An exception here and there	77546.30656519881
Handsome yes pretty in a way you find but what I m talking about is the female form	310.18775687684774
Besides they have so little taste in dress most of them which greatly enhances a woman s natural beauty no matter what you say	89.32073139614603
Rumpled stockings it may be possibly is a foible of mine but still it s a thing I simply hate to see	128.5650438098371
Interest however was starting to flag somewhat all round and then the others got on to talking about accidents at sea ships lost in a fog collisions with icebergs all that sort of thing	26.826957952797255
Shipahoy of course had his own say to say	3231.9688872742468
He had doubled the cape a few odd times and weathered a monsoon a kind of wind in the China seas and through all those perils of the deep there was one thing he declared stood to him or words to that effect a pious medal he had that saved him	9.152473108773892
So then after that they drifted on to the wreck off Daunt s rock wreck of that illfated Norwegian barque nobody could think of her name for the moment till the jarvey who had really quite a look of Henry Campbell remembered it on Booterstown strand	11.583232862547103
That was the talk of the town that year Albert William Quill wrote a fine piece of original verse of distinctive merit on the topic for the Irish breakers running over her and crowds and crowds on the shore in commotion petrified with horror	12.91549665014884
Then someone said something about the case of the s	3432.149752421796
s	3162277660168.3784
of Swansea run into by the which was on an opposite tack in rather muggyish weather and lost with all hands on deck	121.15276586285881
No aid was given	705173.7860574854
Her master the s said he was afraid his collision bulkhead would give way	467.1614321679603
She had no water it appears in her hold	3820.9612656833924
At this stage an incident happened	18945.991841651667
It having become necessary for him to unfurl a reef the sailor vacated his seat	322.9620839824864
Let me cross your bows mate he said to his neighbour who was just gently dropping off into a peaceful doze	164.61677277843285
He made tracks heavily slowly with a dumpy sort of a gait to the door stepped heavily down the one step there was out of the shelter and bore due left	36.51741272548377
While he was in the act of getting his bearings Mr Bloom who noticed when he stood up that he had two flasks of presumably ship s rum sticking one out of each pocket for the private consumption of his burning interior saw him produce a bottle and uncork it or unscrew and applying its nozzle to his lips take a good old delectable swig out of it with a gurgling noise	4.840960141478948
The irrepressible Bloom who also had a shrewd suspicion that the old stager went out on a manœuvre after the counterattraction in the shape of a female who however had disappeared to all intents and purposes could by straining just perceive him when duly refreshed by his rum puncheon exploit gaping up at the piers and girders of the Loop line rather out of his depth as of course it was all radically altered since his last visit and greatly improved	4.071515547789689
Some person or persons invisible directed him to the male urinal erected by the cleansing committee all over the place for the purpose but after a brief space of time during which silence reigned supreme the sailor evidently giving it a wide berth eased himself closer at hand the noise of his bilgewater some little time subsequently splashing on the ground where it apparently awoke a horse of the cabrank	5.0608719869196825
A hoof scooped anyway for new foothold after sleep and harness jingled	517.8457467068547
Slightly disturbed in his sentrybox by the brazier of live coke the watcher of the corporation stones who though now broken down and fast breaking up was none other in stern reality than the Gumley aforesaid now practically on the parish rates given the temporary job by Pat Tobin in all human probability from dictates of humanity knowing him before shifted about and shuffled in his box before composing his limbs again in to the arms of Morpheus a truly amazing piece of hard lines in its most virulent form on a fellow most respectably connected and familiarised with decent home comforts all his life who came in for a cool a year at one time which of course the doublebarrelled ass proceeded to make general ducks and drakes of	2.4081270125596355
He drank needless to be told and it pointed only once more a moral when he might quite easily be in a large way of business if a big if however he had contrived to cure himself of his particular partiality	15.505157798326243
All meantime were loudly lamenting the falling off in Irish shipping coastwise and foreign as well which was all part and parcel of the same thing	71.09709432312432
A Palgrave Murphy boat was put off the ways at Alexandra basin the only launch that year	226.0988243093428
Right enough the harbours were there only no ships ever called	685.3585447983944
There were wrecks and wreckers the keeper said who was evidently	903.1120823456813
What he wanted to ascertain was why that ship ran bang against the only rock in Galway bay when the Galway harbour scheme was mooted by a Mr Worthington or some name like that eh	24.484367468222267
Ask the then captain he advised them how much palmoil the British government gave him for that day s work Captain John Lever of the Lever Line	61.05402296585327
Am I right skipper	377704.8722950482
he queried of the sailor now returning after his private potation and the rest of his exertions	499.19497551228915
That worthy picking up the scent of the fagend of the song or words growled in wouldbe music but with great vim some kind of chanty or other in seconds or thirds	32.74549162877729
Mr Bloom s sharp ears heard him then expectorate the plug probably which it was so that he must have lodged it for the time being in his fist while he did the drinking and making water jobs and found it a bit sour after the liquid fire in question	9.55855309468529
Anyhow in he rolled after his successful libation potation introducing an atmosphere of drink into the boisterously trolling like a veritable son of a seacook The biscuits was as hard as brass And the beef as salt as Lot s wife s arse	13.68874509537081
O Johnny Lever	13586334.383236524
Johnny Lever O	4791485.144722861
After which effusion the redoubtable specimen duly arrived on the scene and regaining his seat he sank rather than sat heavily on the form provided	77.77828556816584
Skin the Goat assuming he was he evidently with an axe to grind was airing his grievances in a forcible feeble philippic anent the natural resources of Ireland or something of that sort which he described in his lengthy dissertation as the richest country bar none on the face of God s earth far and away superior to England with coal in large quantities six million pounds worth of pork exported every year ten millions between butter and eggs and all the riches drained out of it by England levying taxes on the poor people that paid through the nose always and gobbling up the best meat in the market and a lot more surplus steam in the same vein	2.589543080585877
Their conversation accordingly became general and all agreed that that was a fact	682.8043336724993
Where would you find anywhere the like of Irish bacon	2161.5574354510554
But a day of reckoning he stated with no uncertain voice thoroughly monopolising all the conversation was in store for mighty England despite her power of pelf on account of her crimes	32.74549162877729
There would be a fall and the greatest fall in history	2149.3610855631114
The Germans and the Japs were going to have their little lookin he affirmed	653.5028925959369
The Boers were the beginning of the end	11213.125613261142
Brummagem England was toppling already and her downfall would be Ireland her Achilles heel which he explained to them about the vulnerable point of Achilles the Greek hero a point his auditors at once seized as he completely gripped their attention by showing the tendon referred to on his boot	9.55855309468529
His advice to every Irishman was stay in the land of your birth and work for Ireland and live for Ireland	172.2591560689172
Ireland Parnell said could not spare a single one of her sons	1047.755973943366
Silence all round marked the termination of his	3398.412267230092
The impervious navigator heard these lurid tidings undismayed	3418.094355746142
Take a bit of doing boss retaliated that rough diamond palpably a bit peeved in response to the foregoing truism	128.05372138347371
To which cold douche referring to downfall and so on the keeper concurred but nevertheless held to his main view	144.1442547479435
Who s the best troops in the army	9856.195547403167
the grizzled old veteran irately interrogated	29411.74824355255
And the best jumpers and racers	33240.153128406
And the best admirals and generals we ve got	2208.6604683534842
Tell me that	8149112.405418825
The Irish for choice retorted the cabby like Campbell facial blemishes apart	509.1374454827403
That s right the old tarpaulin corroborated	14585.440356112527
The Irish catholic peasant	943877.1553065854
He s the backbone of our empire	19744.925746104305
You know Jem Mullins	661631.3834818287
While allowing him his individual opinions as everyman the keeper added he cared nothing for any empire ours or his and considered no Irishman worthy of his salt that served it	36.51741272548377
Then they began to have a few irascible words when it waxed hotter both needless to say appealing to the listeners who followed the passage of arms with interest so long as they didn t indulge in recriminations and come to blows	14.547578108480476
From inside information extending over a series of years Mr Bloom was rather inclined to poohpooh the suggestion as egregious balderdash for pending that consummation devoutly to be or not to be wished for he was fully cognisant of the fact that their neighbours across the channel unless they were much bigger fools than he took them for rather concealed their strength than the opposite	5.722367659350217
It was quite on a par with the quixotic idea in certain quarters that in a hundred million years the coal seam of the sister island would be played out and if as time went on that turned out to be how the cat jumped all he could personally say on the matter was that as a host of contingencies equally relevant to the issue might occur ere then it was highly advisable in the interim to try to make the most of both countries even though poles apart	3.5938136638046276
Another little interesting point the amours of whores and chummies to put it in common parlance reminded him Irish soldiers had as often fought for England as against her more so in fact	29.552092352028872
And now why	17043722.579618733
So the scene between the pair of them the licensee of the place rumoured to be or have been Fitzharris the famous invincible and the other obviously bogus reminded him forcibly as being on all fours with the confidence trick supposing that is it was prearranged as the lookeron a student of the human soul if anything the others seeing least of the game	5.878016072274914
And as for the lessee or keeper who probably wasn t the other person at all he B couldn t help feeling and most properly it was better to give people like that the goby unless you were a blithering idiot altogether and refuse to have anything to do with them as a golden rule in private life and their felonsetting there always being the offchance of a Dannyman coming forward and turning queen s evidence or king s now like Denis or Peter Carey an idea he utterly repudiated	3.5436477855785484
Quite apart from that he disliked those careers of wrongdoing and crime on principle	325.9141110135559
Yet though such criminal propensities had never been an inmate of his bosom in any shape or form he certainly did feel and no denying it while inwardly remaining what he was a certain kind of admiration for a man who had actually brandished a knife cold steel with the courage of his political convictions though personally he would never be a party to any such thing off the same bat as those love vendettas of the south have her or swing for her when the husband frequently after some words passed between the two concerning her relations with the other lucky mortal he having had the pair watched inflicted fatal injuries on his adored one as a result of an alternative postnuptial by plunging his knife into her until it just struck him that Fitz nicknamed Skin the Goat merely drove the car for the actual perpetrators of the outrage and so was not if he was reliably informed actually party to the ambush which in point of fact was the plea some legal luminary saved his skin on	1.8890484375835332
In any case that was very ancient history by now and as for our friend the pseudo Skin the etcetera he had transparently outlived his welcome	71.09709432312432
He ought to have either died naturally or on the scaffold high	962.924986915038
Like actresses always farewell positively last performance then come up smiling again	443.8257140365642
Generous to a fault of course temperamental no economising or any idea of the sort always snapping at the bone for the shadow	121.15276586285881
So similarly he had a very shrewd suspicion that Mr Johnny Lever got rid of some	298.0342620254435
s	3162277660168.3784

in the course of his perambulations round the docks in the congenial atmosphere of the tavern come back to Erin and so on	121.15276586285881
Then as for the other he had heard not so long before the same identical lingo as he told Stephen how he simply but effectually silenced the offender	52.983169062837085
He took umbrage at something or other that muchinjured but on the whole eventempered person declared I let slip	177.11025988549446
He called me a jew and in a heated fashion offensively	2535.486147588261
So I without deviating from plain facts in the least told him his God I mean Christ was a jew too and all his family like me though in reality I m not	29.552092352028872
That was one for him	166289.6303816959
A soft answer turns away wrath	27407.062135297645
He hadn t a word to say for himself as everyone saw	1388.367331141475
Am I not right	453433.2145571357
He turned a long you are wrong gaze on Stephen of timorous dark pride at the soft impeachment with a glance also of entreaty for he seemed to glean in a kind of a way that it wasn t all exactly	15.505157798326243
Stephen mumbled in a noncommittal accent their two or four eyes conversing or Bloom his name is or after all any other	124.63502165424877
Of course Mr B	512587.3991652899
proceeded to stipulate you must look at both sides of the question	931.8413807302919
It is hard to lay down any hard and fast rules as to right and wrong but room for improvement all round there certainly is though every country they say our own distressful included has the government it deserves	17.782794100389232
But with a little goodwill all round	17367.56382667073
It s all very fine to boast of mutual superiority but what about mutual equality	280.37148430128235
I resent violence and intolerance in any shape or form	1346.7647639386494
It never reaches anything or stops anything	8107.7825680003
A revolution must come on the due instalments plan	4034.0475106861745
It s a patent absurdity on the face of it to hate people because they live round the corner and speak another vernacular in the next house so to speak	41.011270705513006
Memorable bloody bridge battle and seven minutes war Stephen assented between Skinner s alley and Ormond market	98.66538825186198
And the whole world was full of that sort of thing	1853.539731803794
You just took the words out of my mouth he said	2256.2888618564943
A hocuspocus of conflicting evidence that candidly you couldn t remotely	796.8194822243712
All those wretched quarrels in his humble opinion stirring up bad blood from some bump of combativeness or gland of some kind erroneously supposed to be about a punctilio of honour and a flag were very largely a question of the money question which was at the back of everything greed and jealousy people never knowing when to stop	6.812920690579612
They accuse remarked he audibly	87782.38949154575
He turned away from the others who probably and spoke nearer to so as the others in case they Jews he softly imparted in an aside in Stephen s ear are accused of ruining	26.826957952797255
Not a vestige of truth in it I can safely say	1235.9005896125636
History would you be surprised to learn proves up to the hilt Spain decayed when the inquisition hounded the jews out and England prospered when Cromwell an uncommonly able ruffian who in other respects has much to answer for imported them	15.505157798326243
Why	3162277660168.3784
Because they are imbued with the proper spirit	8461.125943448975
They are practical and are proved to be so	2847.366065243674
I don t want to indulge in any because you know the standard works on the subject and then orthodox as you are	121.15276586285881

That s the vital issue at stake and it s feasible and would be provocative of friendlier intercourse between man and man	114.14306057439437

Where you can live well the sense is if you work	1542.4872383767774
Over his untastable apology for a cup of coffee listening to this synopsis of things in general Stephen stared at nothing in particular	107.28133296926006
He could hear of course all kinds of words changing colour like those crabs about Ringsend in the morning burrowing quickly into all colours of different sorts of the same sand where they had a home somewhere beneath or seemed to	15.505157798326243
Then he looked up and saw the eyes that said or didn t say the words the voice he heard said if you work	100.00000000000001
Count me out he managed to remark meaning work	1666.7693539389827
The eyes were surprised at this observation because as he the person who owned them pro tem	297.09335909324506
observed or rather his voice speaking did all must work have to together	527.4950836546992
I mean of course the other hastened to affirm work in the widest possible sense	531.4999193357173
Also literary labour not merely for the kudos of the thing	1180.4721149391376
Writing for the newspapers which is the readiest channel nowadays	1709.486983219928
That s work too	938086.2090703067
Important work	310118385.0482162
After all from the little I know of you after all the money expended on your education you are entitled to recoup yourself and command your price	61.05402296585327
You have every bit as much right to live by your pen in pursuit of your philosophy as the peasant has	173.74718835729354
What	3162277660168.3784
You both belong to Ireland the brain and the brawn	2636.634844783295
Each is equally important	350179.14551611256
You suspect Stephen retorted with a sort of a half laugh that I may be important because I belong to the Saint called Ireland for short	71.09709432312432
I would go a step farther Mr Bloom insinuated	5438.600161975066
But I suspect Stephen interrupted that Ireland must be important because it belongs to me	305.78647730798696
What belongs queried Mr Bloom bending fancying he was perhaps under some misapprehension	675.2313428961781
Excuse me	367684382.58433324
Unfortunately I didn t catch the latter portion	4380.5560335324635
What was it you	1153669.808335687
Stephen patently crosstempered repeated and shoved aside his mug of coffee or whatever you like to call it none too politely adding We can t change the country	52.983169062837085
At this pertinent suggestion Mr Bloom to change the subject looked down but in a quandary as he couldn t tell exactly what construction to put on belongs to which sounded rather a far cry	24.484367468222267
The rebuke of some kind was clearer than the other part	1575.0862082183323
Needless to say the fumes of his recent orgy spoke then with some asperity in a curious bitter way foreign to his sober state	100.00000000000001
Probably the homelife to which Mr B attached the utmost importance had not been all that was needful or he hadn t been familiarised with the right sort of people	41.011270705513006
With a touch of fear for the young man beside him whom he furtively scrutinised with an air of some consternation remembering he had just come back from Paris the eyes more especially reminding him forcibly of father and sister failing to throw much light on the subject however he brought to mind instances of cultured fellows that promised so brilliantly nipped in the bud of premature decay and nobody to blame but themselves	4.641588833612779
For instance there was the case of O Callaghan for one the halfcrazy faddist respectably connected though of inadequate means with his mad vagaries among whose other gay doings when rotto and making himself a nuisance to everybody all round he was in the habit of ostentatiously sporting in public a suit of brown paper a fact	7.2789538439831505
And then the usual after the fun had gone on fast and furious he got landed into hot water and had to be spirited away by a few friends after a strong hint to a blind horse from John Mallon of Lower Castle Yard so as not to be made amenable under section two of the criminal law amendment act certain names of those subpœnaed being handed in but not divulged for reasons which will occur to anyone with a pick of brains	3.9376589235643866
Briefly putting two and two together six sixteen which he pointedly turned a deaf ear to Antonio and so forth jockeys and esthetes and the tattoo which was all the go in the seventies or thereabouts even in the house of lords because early in life the occupant of the throne then heir apparent the other members of the upper ten and other high personages simply following in the footsteps of the head of the state he reflected about the errors of notorieties and crowned heads running counter to morality such as the Cornwall case a number of years before under their veneer in a way scarcely intended by nature a thing good Mrs Grundy as the law stands was terribly down on though not for the reason they thought they were probably whatever it was except women chiefly who were always fiddling more or less at one another it being largely a matter of dress and all the rest of it	2.02650867063685

Highly unlikely of course there was even a shadow of truth in the stones and even supposing he thought a return highly inadvisable all things considered	71.09709432312432
Something evidently riled them in his death	13473.481603884347
Either he petered out too tamely of acute pneumonia just when his various different political arrangements were nearing completion or whether it transpired he owed his death to his having neglected to change his boots and clothes after a wetting when a cold resulted and failing to consult a specialist he being confined to his room till he eventually died of it amid widespread regret before a fortnight was at an end or quite possibly they were distressed to find the job was taken out of their hands	3.6458412370707323
Of course nobody being acquainted with his movements even before there was absolutely no clue as to his whereabouts which were decidedly of the where art order even prior to his starting to go under several aliases such as Fox and Stewart so the remark which emanated from friend cabby might be within the bounds of possibility	7.2789538439831505
Naturally then it would prey on his mind as a born leader of men which undoubtedly he was and a commanding figure a sixfooter or at any rate five feet ten or eleven in his stockinged feet whereas Messrs So and So who though they weren t even a patch on the former man ruled the roost after their redeeming features were very few and far between	5.4361836201538365

As regards Bloom he without the faintest suspicion of a smile merely gazed in the direction of the door and reflected upon the historic story which had aroused extraordinary interest at the time when the facts to make matters worse were made public with the usual affectionate letters that passed between them full of sweet nothings	7.53690398089854
First it was strictly Platonic till nature intervened and an attachment sprang up between them till bit by bit matters came to a climax and the matter became the talk of the town till the staggering blow came as a welcome intelligence to not a few evildisposed however who were resolved upon encompassing his downfall though the thing was public property all along though not to anything like the sensational extent that it subsequently blossomed into	4.460162165376301
Since their names were coupled though since he was her declared favourite where was the particular necessity to proclaim it to the rank and file from the housetops the fact namely that he had shared her bedroom which came out in the witnessbox on oath when a thrill went through the packed court literally electrifying everybody in the shape of witnesses swearing to having witnessed him on such and such a particular date in the act of scrambling out of an upstairs apartment with the assistance of a ladder in night apparel having gained admittance in the same fashion a fact the weeklies addicted to the lubric a little simply coined shoals of money out of	2.6751640979693976
Whereas the simple fact of the case was it was simply a case of the husband not being up to the scratch with nothing in common between them beyond the name and then a real man arriving on the scene strong to the verge of weakness falling a victim to her siren charms and forgetting home ties the usual sequel to bask in the loved one s smiles	5.30441727984393
The eternal question of the life connubial needless to say cropped up	1186.3373226859483
Can real love supposing there happens to be another chap in the case exist between married folk	247.18391620389858

A magnificent specimen of manhood he was truly augmented obviously by gifts of a high order as compared with the other military supernumerary that is who was just the usual everyday my gallant kind of an individual in the light dragoons the th hussars to be accurate and inflammable doubtless the fallen leader that is not the other in his own peculiar way which she of course woman quickly perceived as highly likely to carve his way to fame which he almost bid fair to do till the priests and ministers of the gospel as a whole his erstwhile staunch adherents and his beloved evicted tenants for whom he had done yeoman service in the rural parts of the country by taking up the cudgels on their behalf in a way that exceeded their most sanguine expectations very effectually cooked his matrimonial goose thereby heaping coals of fire on his head much in the same way as the fabled ass s kick	2.02650867063685
Looking back now in a retrospective kind of arrangement all seemed a kind of dream	409.3859707357086
And then coming back was the worst thing you ever did because it went without saying you would feel out of place as things always moved with the times	46.415888336127786
Why as he reflected Irishtown strand a locality he had not been in for quite a number of years looked different somehow since as it happened he went to reside on the north side	26.826957952797255
North or south however it was just the wellknown case of hot passion pure and simple upsetting the applecart with a vengeance and just bore out the very thing he was saying as she also was Spanish or half so types that wouldn t do things by halves passionate abandon of the south casting every shred of decency to the winds	6.40400427119728
Just bears out what I was saying he with glowing bosom said to Stephen about blood and the sun	278.56767334351605
And if I don t greatly mistake she was Spanish too	1788.790765482612
The king of Spain s daughter Stephen answered adding something or other rather muddled about farewell and adieu to you Spanish onions and the first land called the Deadman and from Ramhead to Scilly was so and so many	17.782794100389232
Was she	1042355577.0039501
Bloom ejaculated surprised though not astonished by any means I never heard that rumour before	348.3915304233034
Possible especially there it was as she lived there	3062.586382194056
So Spain	1448009205.6790397
Carefully avoiding a book in his pocket which reminded him by the by of that Capel street library book out of date he took out his pocketbook and turning over the various contents it contained rapidly finally he	19.14481976169958
Do you consider by the by he said thoughtfully selecting a faded photo which he laid on the table that a Spanish type	121.15276586285881
Stephen obviously addressed looked down on the photo showing a large sized lady with her fleshy charms on evidence in an open fashion as she was in the full bloom of womanhood in evening dress cut ostentatiously low for the occasion to give a liberal display of bosom with more than vision of breasts her full lips parted and some perfect teeth standing near ostensibly with gravity a piano on the rest of which was Old a ballad pretty in its way which was then all the vogue	3.6458412370707323
Her the lady s eyes dark large looked at Stephen about to smile about something to be admired Lafayette of Westmoreland street Dublin s premier photographic artist being responsible for the esthetic execution	29.552092352028872
Mrs Bloom my wife the Madam Marion Tweedy Bloom indicated	1396.2432384238782
Taken a few years since	75571.6293358985
In or about ninety six	116627.93577731385
Very like her then	700016.5497954474
Beside the young man he looked also at the photo of the lady now his legal wife who he intimated was the accomplished daughter of Major Brian Tweedy and displayed at an early age remarkable proficiency as a singer having even made her bow to the public when her years numbered barely sweet sixteen	8.11130830789687
As for the face it was a speaking likeness in expression but it did not do justice to her figure which came in for a lot of notice usually and which did not come out to the best advantage in that getup	14.547578108480476
He dwelt being a bit of an artist in his spare time on the female form in general developmentally because as it so happened no later than that afternoon he had seen those Grecian statues perfectly developed as works of art in the National Museum	12.216773489967919
Marble could give the original shoulders back all the symmetry all the rest	648.295594021993
Yes puritanisme it does though Saint Joseph s sovereign thievery alors Bandez Figne toi trop	171.66590748828526
Whereas no photo could because it simply wasn t art in a word	586.3537671177131
The spirit moving him he would much have liked to follow Jack Tar s good example and leave the likeness there for a very few minutes to speak for itself on the plea he so that the other could drink in the beauty for himself her stage presence being frankly a treat in itself which the camera could not at all do justice to	5.878016072274914
But it was scarcely professional etiquette so	12469.285912480393
Though it was a warm pleasant sort of a night now yet wonderfully cool for the season considering for sunshine after storm	128.7624470818482
And he did feel a kind of need there and then to follow suit like a kind of inward voice and satisfy a possible need by moving a motion	46.415888336127786
Nevertheless he sat tight just viewing the slightly soiled photo creased by opulent curves none the worse for wear however and looked away thoughtfully with the intention of not further increasing the other s possible embarrassment while gauging her symmetry of heaving	14.547578108480476
In fact the slight soiling was only an added charm like the case of linen slightly soiled good as new much better in fact with the starch out	52.983169062837085
I looked for the lamp which she told me came into his mind but merely as a passing fancy of his because he then recollected the morning littered bed etcetera and the book about Ruby with met him pike hoses in it which must have fell down sufficiently appropriately beside the domestic chamberpot with apologies to Lindley Murray	7.038135554931555
The vicinity of the young man he certainly relished educated and impulsive into the bargain far and away the pick of the bunch though you wouldn t think he had it in him yet you would	22.456979955397745
Besides he said the picture was handsome which say what you like it was though at the moment she was distinctly stouter	149.24955450518294
And why not	16168084.869109185
An awful lot of makebelieve went on about that sort of thing involving a lifelong slur with the usual splash page of gutterpress about the same old matrimonial tangle alleging misconduct with professional golfer or the newest stage favourite instead of being honest and aboveboard about the whole business	10.0
How they were fated to meet and an attachment sprang up between the two so that their names were coupled in the public eye was told in court with letters containing the habitual mushy and compromising expressions leaving no loophole to show that they openly cohabited two or three times a week at some wellknown seaside hotel and relations when the thing ran its normal course became in due course intimate	4.948168092155143
Then the decree and the King s proctor tries to show cause why and he failing to quash it was made absolute	149.09789673376872
But as for that the two misdemeanants wrapped up as they largely were in one another could safely afford to ignore it as they very largely did till the matter was put in the hands of a solicitor who filed a petition for the party wronged in due course	10.0
He B enjoyed the distinction of being close to Erin s uncrowned king in the flesh when the thing occurred on the historic when the fallen leader s who notoriously stuck to his guns to the last drop even when clothed in the mantle of adultery leader s trusty henchmen to the number of ten or a dozen or possibly even more than that penetrated into the printing works of the or no it was a by no means by the by appropriate appellative and broke up the typecases with hammers or something like that all on account of some scurrilous effusions from the facile pens of the O Brienite scribes at the usual mudslinging occupation reflecting on the erstwhile tribune s private morals	2.51188643150958
Though palpably a radically altered man he was still a commanding figure though carelessly garbed as usual with that look of settled purpose which went a long way with the shillyshallyers till they discovered to their vast discomfiture that their idol had feet of clay after placing him upon a pedestal which she however was the first to perceive	6.812920690579612
As those were particularly hot times in the general hullaballoo Bloom sustained a minor injury from a nasty prod of some chap s elbow in the crowd that of course congregated lodging some place about the pit of the stomach fortunately not of a grave character	11.583232862547103
His hat Parnell s a silk one was inadvertently knocked off and as a matter of strict history Bloom was the man who picked it up in the crush after witnessing the occurrence meaning to return it to him and return it to him he did with the utmost celerity who panting and hatless and whose thoughts were miles away from his hat at the time all the same being a gentleman born with a stake in the country he as a matter of fact having gone into it more for the kudos of the thing than anything else what s bred in the bone instilled into him in infancy at his mother s knee in the shape of knowing what good form was came out at once because he turned round to the donor and thanked him with perfect saying you though in a very different tone of voice from the ornament of the legal profession whose headgear Bloom also set to rights earlier in the course of the day history repeating itself with a difference after the burial of a mutual friend when they had left him alone in his glory after the grim task of having committed his remains to the grave	1.7487126295116875
On the other hand what incensed him more inwardly was the blatant jokes of the cabman and so on who passed it all off as a jest laughing immoderately pretending to understand everything the why and the wherefore and in reality not knowing their own minds it being a case for the two parties themselves unless it ensued that the legitimate husband happened to be a party to it owing to some anonymous letter from the usual boy Jones who happened to come across them at the crucial moment in a loving position locked in one another s arms drawing attention to their illicit proceedings and leading up to a domestic rumpus and the erring fair one begging forgiveness of her lord and master upon her knees and promising to sever the connection and not receive his visits any more if only the aggrieved husband would overlook the matter and let bygones be bygones with tears in her eyes though possibly with her tongue in her fair cheek at the same time as quite possibly there were several others	1.8957356524063758
He personally being of a sceptical bias believed and didn t make the smallest bones about saying so either that man or men in the plural were always hanging around on the waiting list about a lady even supposing she was the best wife in the world and they got on fairly well together for the sake of argument when neglecting her duties she chose to be tired of wedded life and was on for a little flutter in polite debauchery to press their attentions on her with improper intent the upshot being that her affections centred on another the cause of many between still attractive married women getting on for fair and forty and younger men no doubt as several famous cases of feminine infatuation proved up to the hilt	2.392147081462638
It was a thousand pities a young fellow blessed with an allowance of brains as his neighbour obviously was should waste his valuable time with profligate women who might present him with a nice dose to last him his lifetime	16.57723885589317
In the nature of single blessedness he would one day take unto himself a wife when Miss Right came on the scene but in the interim ladies society was a sine qua though he had the gravest possible doubts not that he wanted in the smallest to pump Stephen about Miss Ferguson who was very possibly the particular lodestar who brought him down to Irishtown so early in the morning as to whether he would find much satisfaction basking in the boy and girl courtship idea and the company of smirking misses without a penny to their names bi or triweekly with the orthodox preliminary canter of complimentplaying and walking out leading up to fond lovers ways and flowers and chocs	2.5694257109482446
To think of him house and homeless rooked by some landlady worse than any stepmother was really too bad at his age	127.285657300633
The queer suddenly things he popped out with attracted the elder man who was several years the other s senior or like his father but something substantial he certainly ought to eat even were it only an eggflip made on unadulterated maternal nutriment or failing that the homely Humpty Dumpty boiled	9.152473108773892
At what o clock did you dine	12556.973709163323
he questioned of the slim form and tired though unwrinkled face	1479.5501337883204
Some time yesterday Stephen said	63686.47047335187
Yesterday	3162277660168.3784
exclaimed Bloom till he remembered it was already tomorrow Friday	1886.871059456407
Ah you mean it s after twelve	20128.43320465945
The day before yesterday Stephen said improving on himself	3500.482311711425
Literally astounded at this piece of intelligence Bloom reflected	1614.3034915707922
Though they didn t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there somehow was as if both their minds were travelling so to speak in the one train of thought	32.74549162877729
At his age when dabbling in politics roughly some score of years previously when he had been a aspirant to parliamentary honours in the Buckshot Foster days he too recollected in retrospect which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself he had a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas	9.152473108773892
For instance when the evicted tenants question then at its first inception bulked largely in people s mind though it goes without saying not contributing a copper or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums some of which wouldn t exactly hold water he at the outset in principle at all events was in thorough sympathy with peasant possession as voicing the trend of modern opinion a partiality however which realising his mistake he was subsequently partially cured of and even was twitted with going a step farther than Michael Davitt in the striking views he at one time inculcated as a backtothelander which was one reason he strongly resented the innuendo put upon him in so barefaced a fashion by our friend at the gathering of the clans in Barney Kiernan s so that he though often considerably misunderstood and the least pugnacious of mortals be it repeated departed from his customary habit to give him metaphorically one in the gizzard though so far as politics themselves were concerned he was only too conscious of the casualties invariably resulting from propaganda and displays of mutual animosity and the misery and suffering it entailed as a foregone conclusion on fine young fellows chiefly destruction of the fittest in a word	1.725706061858534
Anyhow upon weighing up the pros and cons getting on for one as it was it was high time to be retiring for the night	83.76776400682921
The crux was it was a bit risky to bring him home as eventualities might possibly ensue somebody having a temper of her own sometimes and spoil the hash altogether as on the night he misguidedly brought home a dog breed unknown with a lame paw not that the cases were either identical or the reverse though he had hurt his hand too to Ontario Terrace as he very distinctly remembered having been there so to speak	4.3754793750741845
On the other hand it was altogether far and away too late for the Sandymount or Sandycove suggestion so that he was in some perplexity as to which of the two alternatives	32.74549162877729
Everything pointed to the fact that it behoved him to avail himself to the full of the opportunity all things considered	187.38174228603845
His initial impression was he was a shade standoffish or not over effusive but it grew on him someway	232.49295409609329
For one thing he mightn t what you call jump at the idea if approached and what mostly worried him was he didn t know how to lead up to it or word it exactly supposing he did entertain the proposal as it would afford him very great personal pleasure if he would allow him to help to put coin in his way or some wardrobe if found suitable	5.179474679231211
At all events he wound up by concluding eschewing for the nonce hidebound precedent a cup of Epps s cocoa and a shakedown for the night plus the use of a rug or two and overcoat doubled into a pillow at least he would be in safe hands and as warm as a toast on a trivet he failed to perceive any very vast amount of harm in that always with the proviso no rumpus of any sort was kicked up	4.071515547789689
A move had to be made because that merry old soul the grasswidower in question who appeared to be glued to the spot didn t appear in any particular hurry to wend his way home to his dearly beloved Queenstown and it was highly likely some sponger s bawdyhouse of retired beauties where age was no bar off Sheriff street lower would be the best clue to that equivocal character s whereabouts for a few days to come alternately racking their feelings the mermaids with sixchamber revolver anecdotes verging on the tropical calculated to freeze the marrow of anybody s bones and mauling their largesized charms betweenwhiles with rough and tumble gusto to the accompaniment of large potations of potheen and the usual blarney about himself for as to who he in reality was let x equal my right name and address as Mr Algebra remarks	2.188447106460033
At the same time he inwardly chuckled over his gentle repartee to the blood and ouns champion about his god being a jew	121.15276586285881
People could put up with being bitten by a wolf but what properly riled them was a bite from a sheep	166.66019534885078
The most vulnerable point too of tender Achilles	4913.1653184563675
Your god was a jew	110711.78692572878
Because mostly they appeared to imagine he came from Carrick on Shannon or somewhereabouts in the county Sligo	185.08794369707866
I propose our hero eventually suggested after mature reflection while prudently pocketing her photo as it s rather stuffy here you just come home with me and talk things over	41.011270705513006
My diggings are quite close in the vicinity	6164.215375258828
You can t drink that stuff	34979.64302863811
Do you like cocoa	931493.9197013018
Wait	3162277660168.3784
I ll just pay this lot	31348.642511480986
Yes that s the best he assured Stephen to whom for the matter of that Brazen Head or him or anywhere else was all more or less	61.05402296585327
All kinds of Utopian plans were flashing through his B s busy brain education the genuine article literature journalism prize titbits up to date billing concert tours in English watering resorts packed with hydros and seaside theatres turning money away duets in Italian with the accent perfectly true to nature and a quantity of other things no necessity of course to tell the world and his wife from the housetops about it and a slice of luck	4.3754793750741845
An opening was all was wanted	35186.60919518549
Because he more than suspected he had his father s voice to bank his hopes on which it was quite on the cards he had so it would be just as well by the way no harm to trail the conversation in the direction of that particular red herring just to	9.152473108773892
The cabby read out of the paper he had got hold of that the former viceroy earl Cadogan had presided at the cabdrivers association dinner in London somewhere	52.983169062837085
Silence with a yawn or two accompanied this thrilling announcement	1614.4448078132482
Then the old specimen in the corner who appeared to have some spark of vitality left read out that sir Anthony MacDonnell had left Euston for the chief secretary s lodge or words to that effect	22.456979955397745
To which absorbing piece of intelligence echo answered why	2030.9644317791056
Give us a squint at that literature grandfather the ancient mariner put in manifesting some natural impatience	184.6082413674735
And welcome answered the elderly party thus addressed	4054.051712003624
The sailor lugged out from a case he had a pair of greenish goggles which he very slowly hooked over his nose and both ears	83.76776400682921
Are you bad in the eyes	42965.428309990915
the sympathetic personage like the townclerk queried	20750.5045676666
Why answered the seafarer with the tartan beard who seemingly was a bit of a literary cove in his own small way staring out of seagreen portholes as you might well describe them as I uses goggles reading	19.14481976169958
Sand in the Red Sea done that	9321.485253677238
One time I could read a book in the dark manner of speaking	1131.7616863059093
Arabian Nights was my favourite and as a Rose is She Hereupon he pawed the journal open and pored upon Lord only knows what found drowned or the exploits of King Willow Iremonger having made a hundred and something second wicket not out for Notts during which time completely regardless of Ire the keeper was intensely occupied loosening an apparently new or secondhand boot which manifestly pinched him as he muttered against whoever it was sold it all of them who were sufficiently awake enough to be picked out by their facial expressions that is to say either simply looking on glumly or passing a trivial remark	2.903775007273507
To cut a long story short Bloom grasping the situation was the first to rise from his seat so as not to outstay their welcome having first and foremost being as good as his word that he would foot the bill for the occasion taken the wise precaution to unobtrusively motion to mine host as a parting shot a scarcely perceptible sign when the others were not looking to the effect that the amount due was forthcoming making a grand total of fourpence the amount he deposited unobtrusively in four coppers literally the last of the Mohicans he having previously spotted on the printed pricelist for all who ran to read opposite him in unmistakable figures coffee d confectionery do and honestly well worth twice the money once in a way as Wetherup used to remark	2.317199913684755
Come he counselled to close the	23105.180822225902
Seeing that the ruse worked and the coast was clear they left the shelter or shanty together and the society of oilskin and company whom nothing short of an earthquake would move out of their far	22.456979955397745
Stephen who confessed to still feeling poorly and fagged out paused at the for a moment the door	200.46897915059773
One thing I never understood he said to be original on the spur of the moment	705.5723014103615
To which impromptu the neverfailing Bloom replied without a moment s hesitation saying straight off To sweep the floor in the morning	93.46447940589269
So saying he skipped around nimbly considering frankly at the same time apologetic to get on his companion s right a habit of his by the bye his right side being in classical idiom his tender Achilles	20.691380811147894
The night air was certainly now a treat to breathe though Stephen was a bit weak on his pins	218.48924890809462
It will the air do you good Bloom said meaning also the walk in a moment	564.5005869051419
The only thing is to walk then you ll feel a different man	935.513266818813
Come	3162277660168.3784
It s not far	1031937.983186814
Lean on me	4607455.91249771
Accordingly he passed his left arm in Stephen s right and led him on accordingly	527.9735298532021
Yes Stephen said uncertainly because he thought he felt a strange kind of flesh of a different man approach him sinewless and wobbly and all that	71.09709432312432
Anyhow they passed the sentrybox with stones brazier etc	1984.054118359398
And of coffin of stones the analogy was not at all bad as it was in fact a stoning to death on the part of seventytwo out of eighty odd constituencies that ratted at the time of the split and chiefly the belauded peasant class probably the selfsame evicted tenants he had put in their holdings	7.53690398089854
So they turned on to chatting about music a form of art for which Bloom as a pure amateur possessed the greatest love as they made tracks arm in arm across Beresford place	29.552092352028872
Wagnerian music though confessedly grand in its way was a bit too heavy for Bloom and hard to follow at the first go off but the music of Mercadante s Meyerbeer s Last Words on the and Mozart s he simply revelled in the in that being to his mind the acme of first class music as such literally knocking everything else into a cocked hat	5.575305334261898
He infinitely preferred the sacred music of the catholic church to anything the opposite shop could offer in that line such as those Moody and Sankey hymns or me to live and I will live thy protestant to	19.14481976169958
He also yielded to none in his admiration of Rossini s a work simply abounding in immortal numbers in which his wife Madam Marion Tweedy made a hit a veritable sensation he might safely say greatly adding to her other laurels and putting the others totally in the shade in the jesuit fathers church in upper Gardiner street the sacred edifice being thronged to the doors to hear her with virtuosos or rather	4.738879609717654
There was the unanimous opinion that there was none to come up to her and suffice it to say in a place of worship for music of a sacred character there was a generally voiced desire for an encore	17.782794100389232
On the whole though favouring preferably light opera of the description and a gem in its line he had a though with only a surface knowledge for the severe classical school such as Mendelssohn	26.826957952797255
And talking of that taking it for granted he knew all about the old favourites he mentioned Lionel s air in M which curiously enough he had heard or overheard to be more accurate on yesterday a privilege he keenly appreciated from the lips of Stephen s respected father sung to perfection a study of the number in fact which made all the others take a back seat	5.30441727984393
Stephen in reply to a politely put query said he didn t sing it but launched out into praises of Shakespeare s songs at least of in or about that period the lutenist Dowland who lived in Fetter lane near Gerard the herbalist who ludendo hausi an instrument he was contemplating purchasing from Mr Arnold Dolmetsch whom B	7.038135554931555
did not quite recall though the name certainly sounded familiar for sixtyfive guineas and Farnaby and son with their and conceits and Byrd William who played the virginals he said in the Queen s chapel or anywhere else he found them and one Tomkins who made toys or airs and John Bull	8.778013135972484
On the roadway which they were approaching whilst still speaking beyond the swingchains a horse dragging a sweeper paced on the paven ground brushing a long swathe of mire up so that with the noise Bloom was not perfectly certain whether he had caught aright the allusion to sixtyfive guineas and John Bull	8.431909292866257
He inquired if it was John Bull the political celebrity of that ilk as it struck him the two identical names as a striking coincidence	83.76776400682921
By the chains the horse slowly swerved to turn which perceiving Bloom who was keeping a sharp lookout as usual plucked the other s sleeve gently jocosely remarking Our lives are in peril tonight	26.826957952797255
Beware of the steamroller	1141934.3643647735
They thereupon stopped	10865643.877210485
Bloom looked at the head of a horse not worth anything like sixtyfive guineas suddenly in evidence in the dark quite near so that it seemed new a different grouping of bones and even flesh because palpably it was a fourwalker a hipshaker a blackbuttocker a taildangler a headhanger putting his hind foot foremost the while the lord of his creation sat on the perch busy with his thoughts	5.179474679231211
But such a good poor brute he was sorry he hadn t a lump of sugar but as he wisely reflected you could scarcely be prepared for every emergency that might crop up	29.552092352028872
He was just a big nervous foolish noodly kind of a horse without a second care in the world	284.6303408022737
But even a dog he reflected take that mongrel in Barney Kiernan s of the same size would be a holy horror to face	100.00000000000001
But it was no animal s fault in particular if he was built that way like the camel ship of the desert distilling grapes into potheen in his hump	46.415888336127786
Nine tenths of them all could be caged or trained nothing beyond the art of man barring the bees	143.2160604455394
Whale with a harpoon hairpin alligator tickle the small of his back and he sees the joke chalk a circle for a rooster tiger my eagle eye	61.05402296585327
These timely reflections anent the brutes of the field occupied his mind somewhat distracted from Stephen s words while the ship of the street was manœuvring and Stephen went on about the highly interesting old	24.484367468222267
What s this I was saying	60585.90308375695
Ah yes	590373622.4150964
My wife he intimated plunging medias would have the greatest of pleasure in making your acquaintance as she is passionately attached to music of any kind	71.09709432312432
He looked sideways in a friendly fashion at the sideface of Stephen image of his mother which was not quite the same as the usual handsome blackguard type they unquestionably had an insatiable hankering after as he was perhaps not that way built	13.68874509537081
Still supposing he had his father s gift as he more than suspected it opened up new vistas in his mind such as Lady Fingall s Irish industries concert on the preceding Monday and aristocracy in general	20.691380811147894
Exquisite variations he was now describing on an air here has by Jans Pieter Sweelinck a Dutchman of Amsterdam where the frows come from	56.34430090666756
Even more he liked an old German song of about the clear sea and the voices of sirens sweet murderers of men which boggled Bloom a bit Von der Sirenen Listigkeit Tun die Poeten dichten	24.484367468222267
These opening bars he sang and translated	6679.223087077412
Bloom nodding said he perfectly understood and begged him to go on by all means which he did	315.32342669104014
A phenomenally beautiful tenor voice like that the rarest of boons which Bloom appreciated at the very first note he got out could easily if properly handled by some recognised authority on voice production such as Barraclough and being able to read music into the bargain command its own price where baritones were ten a penny and procure for its fortunate possessor in the near future an into fashionable houses in the best residential quarters of financial magnates in a large way of business and titled people where with his university degree of B	3.359818286283782
A	3162277660168.3784
a huge ad in its way and gentlemanly bearing to all the more influence the good impression he would infallibly score a distinct success being blessed with brains which also could be utilised for the purpose and other requisites if his clothes were properly attended to so as to the better worm his way into their good graces as he a youthful tyro in society s sartorial niceties hardly understood how a little thing like that could militate against you	4.142704447847673
It was in fact only a matter of months and he could easily foresee him participating in their musical and artistic during the festivities of the Christmas season for choice causing a slight flutter in the dovecotes of the fair sex and being made a lot of by ladies out for sensation cases of which as he happened to know were on record in fact without giving the show away he himself once upon a time if he cared to could easily have	3.9376589235643866
Added to which of course would be the pecuniary emolument by no means to be sneezed at going hand in hand with his tuition fees	83.76776400682921
Not he parenthesised that for the sake of filthy lucre he need necessarily embrace the lyric platform as a walk in life for any lengthy space of time	52.983169062837085
But a step in the required direction it was beyond yea or nay and both monetarily and mentally it contained no reflection on his dignity in the smallest and it often turned in uncommonly handy to be handed a cheque at a muchneeded moment when every little helped	10.481131341546856
Besides though taste latterly had deteriorated to a degree original music like that different from the conventional rut would rapidly have a great vogue as it would be a decided novelty for Dublin s musical world after the usual hackneyed run of catchy tenor solos foisted on a confiding public by Ivan St Austell and Hilton St Just and their	6.601948484081891
Yes beyond a shadow of a doubt he could with all the cards in his hand and he had a capital opening to make a name for himself and win a high place in the city s esteem where he could command a stiff figure and booking ahead give a grand concert for the patrons of the King street house given a backerup if one were forthcoming to kick him upstairs so to speak a big however with some impetus of the goahead sort to obviate the inevitable procrastination which often tripped up a too much fêted prince of good fellows	3.0916909765830884
And it need not detract from the other by one iota as being his own master he would have heaps of time to practise literature in his spare moments when desirous of so doing without its clashing with his vocal career or containing anything derogatory whatsoever as it was a matter for himself alone	8.11130830789687
In fact he had the ball at his feet and that was the very reason why the other possessed of a remarkably sharp nose for smelling a rat of any sort hung on to him at all	20.691380811147894
The horse was just then	195319.54259709897
And later on at a propitious opportunity he purposed Bloom did without anyway prying into his private affairs on the step in where principle advising him to sever his connection with a certain budding practitioner who he noticed was prone to disparage and even to a slight extent with some hilarious pretext when not present deprecate him or whatever you like to call it which in Bloom s humble opinion threw a nasty sidelight on that side of a person s character no pun intended	3.814128748283214
The horse having reached the end of his tether so to speak halted and rearing high a proud feathering tail added his quota by letting fall on the floor which the brush would soon brush up and polish three smoking globes of turds	13.68874509537081
Slowly three times one after another from a full crupper he mired	653.1768016556069
And humanely his driver waited till he or she had ended patient in his scythed car	375.83663427678033
Side by side Bloom profiting by the with Stephen passed through the gap of the chains divided by the upright and stepping over a strand of mire went across towards Gardiner street lower Stephen singing more boldly but not loudly the end of the ballad	12.216773489967919
Und alle Schiffe brücken	173044.3816657077
The driver never said a word good bad or indifferent but merely watched the two figures as he sat on his lowbacked car both black one full one lean walk towards the railway bridge be married by Father	19.14481976169958
As they walked they at times stopped and walked again continuing their à which of course he was utterly out of about sirens enemies of man s reason mingled with a number of other topics of the same category usurpers historical cases of the kind while the man in the sweeper car or you might as well call it in the sleeper car who in any case couldn t possibly hear because they were too far simply sat in his seat near the end of lower Gardiner street looked after their lowbacked	3.4485331776221058
What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning	3765.240446441788
Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square west then at reduced pace each bearing left Gardiner s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street then at reduced pace with interruptions of halt bearing right Temple street north as far as Hardwicke place	5.722367659350217
Approaching disparate at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George s church diametrically the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends	40.75280513760923

Bloom assented covertly to Stephen s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus son of Potitus son of Odyssus sent by pope Celestine I in the year in the reign of Leary to the year or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt A D suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree	4.548777947003777
The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud perceived by both from two different points of observation Sandycove and Dublin at first no bigger than a woman s hand	5.722367659350217
Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative	682.3728386030095

What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination	174.90435176367436
He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations	61.05402296585327
As in what ways	574308.367386599

Bloom s decision	17934987.266554933
A stratagem	2716259849.0038157
Resting his feet on the dwarf wall he climbed over the area railings compressed his hat on his head grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall	4.142704447847673

Did the man reappear elsewhere	134052.5425327821
After a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor	102.52669171166163
In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat with his candle	645.1408353048973
Did Stephen obey his sign	76002.05809889152
Yes entering softly he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man s back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom s house	8.11130830789687
What did Bloom do	946805.5504466856
He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone one for Stephen with its back to the area window the other for himself when necessary knelt on one knee composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M Donald of D Olier street kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air	2.589543080585877

What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape stomach and thenar or sole of foot	5.179474679231211

He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible eliminating these conditions	582.7697813071359
There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural as distinct from human law as integral parts of the human whole the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence the agonies of birth and death the monotonous menstruation of simian and particularly human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause inevitable accidents at sea in mines and factories certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations innate lunacy and congenital criminality decimating epidemics catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions the fact of vital growth through convulsions of metamorphosis from infancy through maturity to decay	2.5306134179675253

Did Stephen participate in his dejection	37989.38657970455

The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit	2009.3954977246508
With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations	418.3279029568172
Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster of the moon invisible in incipient lunation approaching perigee of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth of Sirius alpha in Canis Maior lightyears miles distant and in volume times the dimension of our planet of Arcturus of the precession of equinoxes of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which of our solar systems could be contained of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars in reality evermoving wanderers from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years threescore and ten of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity	2.091764655756996
Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast	1188.9252860382687
Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth beneath removable stones in hives and mounds of microbes germs bacteria bacilli spermatozoa of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies each in continuity its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till if the progress were carried far enough nought nowhere was never reached	2.5306134179675253
Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result	761.6609702156055
Because some years previously in when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places e g the th power of the th power of that the result having been obtained closely printed volumes of pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units tens hundreds thousands tens of thousands hundreds of thousands millions tens of millions hundreds of millions billions the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers	2.289350193638287
Did he find the problems of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race given in species and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer easier of solution	20.691380811147894
Of a different order of difficulty	30485.532088893953
Conscious that the human organism normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of tons when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated from nasal hemorrhage impeded respiration and vertigo when proposing this problem for solution he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian Mercurial Veneral Jovian Saturnian Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity	2.2758459260747883

His Bloom s logical conclusion having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error	432.0318737892377
That it was not a heaventree not a heavengrot not a heavenbeast not a heavenman	543.8017763358026
That it was a Utopia there being no known method from the known to the unknown an infinity renderable equally finite by the suppositious apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space remobilised in air a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its probable spectators had entered actual present existence	5.179474679231211
Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle	1901.8288097062157
Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet	22.456979955397745
Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters	150.99851762347697
It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy the lake of dreams the sea of rains the gulf of dews the ocean of fecundity	12.91549665014884
What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman	851.4252981513761

What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom s who attracted Stephen s gaze	919.7778935530644
In the second storey rere of his Bloom s house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O Hara window blind curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer Aungier street	14.547578108480476
How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible attractive person his wife Marion Molly Bloom denoted by a visible splendid sign a lamp	83.22386876026731
With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations with subdued affection and admiration with description with impediment with suggestion	72.63957932604043
Both then were silent	399117.7339480082
Silent each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces	326.5359536776845
Were they indefinitely inactive	352856.8747252164
At Stephen s suggestion at Bloom s instigation both first Stephen then Bloom in penumbra urinated their sides contiguous their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition their gazes first Bloom s then Stephen s elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow	12.216773489967919
The trajectories of their first sequent then simultaneous urinations were dissimilar Bloom s longer less irruent in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter who in his ultimate year at High School had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution scholars Stephen s higher more sibilant who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure	4.460162165376301

Yes because he never did a thing like that before as ask to get his breakfast in bed with a couple of eggs since the hotel when he used to be pretending to be laid up with a sick voice doing his highness to make himself interesting for that old faggot Mrs Riordan that he thought he had a great leg of and she never left us a farthing all for masses for herself and her soul greatest miser ever was actually afraid to lay out d for her methylated spirit telling me all her ailments she had too much old chat in her about politics and earthquakes and the end of the world let us have a bit of fun first God help the world if all the women were her sort down on bathingsuits and lownecks of course nobody wanted her to wear them I suppose she was pious because no man would look at her twice I hope Ill never be like her a wonder she didnt want us to cover our faces but she was a welleducated woman certainly and her gabby talk about Mr Riordan here and Mr Riordan there I suppose he was glad to get shut of her and her dog smelling my fur and always edging to get up under my petticoats especially then still I like that in him polite to old women like that and waiters and beggars too hes not proud out of nothing but not always if ever he got anything really serious the matter with him its much better for them to go into a hospital where everything is clean but I suppose Id have to dring it into him for a month yes and then wed have a hospital nurse next thing on the carpet have him staying there till they throw him out or a nun maybe like the smutty photo he has shes as much a nun as Im not yes because theyre so weak and puling when theyre sick they want a woman to get well if his nose bleeds youd think it was O tragic and that dyinglooking one off the south circular when he sprained his foot at the choir party at the sugarloaf Mountain the day I wore that dress Miss Stack bringing him flowers the worst old ones she could find at the bottom of the basket anything at all to get into a mans bedroom with her old maids voice trying to imagine he was dying on account of her to never see thy face again though he looked more like a man with his beard a bit grown in the bed father was the same besides I hate bandaging and dosing when he cut his toe with the razor paring his corns afraid hed get bloodpoisoning but if it was a thing I was sick then wed see what attention only of course the woman hides it not to give all the trouble they do yes he came somewhere Im sure by his appetite anyway love its not or hed be off his feed thinking of her so either it was one of those night women if it was down there he was really and the hotel story he made up a pack of lies to hide it planning it Hynes kept me who did I meet ah yes I met do you remember Menton and who else who let me see that big babbyface I saw him and he not long married flirting with a young girl at Pooles Myriorama and turned my back on him when he slinked out looking quite conscious what harm but he had the impudence to make up to me one time well done to him mouth almighty and his boiled eyes of all the big stupoes I ever met and thats called a solicitor only for I hate having a long wrangle in bed or else if its not that its some little bitch or other he got in with somewhere or picked up on the sly if they only knew him as well as I do yes because the day before yesterday he was scribbling something a letter when I came into the front room to show him Dignams death in the paper as if something told me and he covered it up with the blottingpaper pretending to be thinking about business so very probably that was it to somebody who thinks she has a softy in him because all men get a bit like that at his age especially getting on to forty he is now so as to wheedle any money she can out of him no fool like an old fool and then the usual kissing my bottom was to hide it not that I care two straws now who he does it with or knew before that way though Id like to find out so long as I dont have the two of them under my nose all the time like that slut that Mary we had in Ontario terrace padding out her false bottom to excite him bad enough to get the smell of those painted women off him once or twice I had a suspicion by getting him to come near me when I found the long hair on his coat without that one when I went into the kitchen pretending he was drinking water woman is not enough for them it was all his fault of course ruining servants then proposing that she could eat at our table on Christmas day if you please O no thank you not in my house stealing my potatoes and the oysters per doz going out to see her aunt if you please common robbery so it was but I was sure he had something on with that one it takes me to find out a thing like that he said you have no proof it was her proof O yes her aunt was very fond of oysters but I told her what I thought of her suggesting me to go out to be alone with her I wouldnt lower myself to spy on them the garters I found in her room the Friday she was out that was enough for me a little bit too much her face swelled up on her with temper when I gave her her weeks notice I saw to that better do without them altogether do out the rooms myself quicker only for the damn cooking and throwing out the dirt I gave it to him anyhow either she or me leaves the house I couldnt even touch him if I thought he was with a dirty barefaced liar and sloven like that one denying it up to my face and singing about the place in the W C too because she knew she was too well off yes because he couldnt possibly do without it that long so he must do it somewhere and the last time he came on my bottom when was it the night Boylan gave my hand a great squeeze going along by the Tolka in my hand there steals another I just pressed the back of his like that with my thumb to squeeze back singing the young May moon shes beaming love because he has an idea about him and me hes not such a fool he said Im dining out and going to the Gaiety though Im not going to give him the satisfaction in any case God knows hes a change in a way not to be always and ever wearing the same old hat unless I paid some nicelooking boy to do it since I cant do it myself a young boy would like me Id confuse him a little alone with him if we were Id let him see my garters the new ones and make him turn red looking at him seduce him I know what boys feel with that down on their cheek doing that frigging drawing out the thing by the hour question and answer would you do this that and the other with the coalman yes with a bishop yes I would because I told him about some dean or bishop was sitting beside me in the jews temples gardens when I was knitting that woollen thing a stranger to Dublin what place was it and so on about the monuments and he tired me out with statues encouraging him making him worse than he is who is in your mind now tell me who are you thinking of who is it tell me his name who tell me who the german Emperor is it yes imagine Im him think of him can you feel him trying to make a whore of me what he never will he ought to give it up now at this age of his life simply ruination for any woman and no satisfaction in it pretending to like it till he comes and then finish it off myself anyway and it makes your lips pale anyhow its done now once and for all with all the talk of the world about it people make its only the first time after that its just the ordinary do it and think no more about it why cant you kiss a man without going and marrying him first you sometimes love to wildly when you feel that way so nice all over you you cant help yourself I wish some man or other would take me sometime when hes there and kiss me in his arms theres nothing like a kiss long and hot down to your soul almost paralyses you then I hate that confession when I used to go to Father Corrigan he touched me father and what harm if he did where and I said on the canal bank like a fool but whereabouts on your person my child on the leg behind high up was it yes rather high up was it where you sit down yes O Lord couldnt he say bottom right out and have done with it what has that got to do with it and did you whatever way he put it I forget no father and I always think of the real father what did he want to know for when I already confessed it to God he had a nice fat hand the palm moist always I wouldnt mind feeling it neither would he Id say by the bullneck in his horsecollar I wonder did he know me in the box I could see his face he couldnt see mine of course hed never turn or let on still his eyes were red when his father died theyre lost for a woman of course must be terrible when a man cries let alone them Id like to be embraced by one in his vestments and the smell of incense off him like the pope besides theres no danger with a priest if youre married hes too careful about himself then give something to H H the pope for a penance I wonder was he satisfied with me one thing I didnt like his slapping me behind going away so familiarly in the hall though I laughed Im not a horse or an ass am I I suppose he was thinking of his fathers I wonder is he awake thinking of me or dreaming am I in it who gave him that flower he said he bought he smelt of some kind of drink not whisky or stout or perhaps the sweety kind of paste they stick their bills up with some liqueur Id like to sip those richlooking green and yellow expensive drinks those stagedoor johnnies drink with the opera hats I tasted once with my finger dipped out of that American that had the squirrel talking stamps with father he had all he could do to keep himself from falling asleep after the last time after we took the port and potted meat it had a fine salty taste yes because I felt lovely and tired myself and fell asleep as sound as a top the moment I popped straight into bed till that thunder woke me up God be merciful to us I thought the heavens were coming down about us to punish us when I blessed myself and said a Hail Mary like those awful thunderbolts in Gibraltar as if the world was coming to an end and then they come and tell you theres no God what could you do if it was running and rushing about nothing only make an act of contrition the candle I lit that evening in Whitefriars street chapel for the month of May see it brought its luck though hed scoff if he heard because he never goes to church mass or meeting he says your soul you have no soul inside only grey matter because he doesnt know what it is to have one yes when I lit the lamp because he must have come or times with that tremendous big red brute of a thing he has I thought the vein or whatever the dickens they call it was going to burst though his nose is not so big after I took off all my things with the blinds down after my hours dressing and perfuming and combing it like iron or some kind of a thick crowbar standing all the time he must have eaten oysters I think a few dozen he was in great singing voice no I never in all my life felt anyone had one the size of that to make you feel full up he must have eaten a whole sheep after whats the idea making us like that with a big hole in the middle of us or like a Stallion driving it up into you because thats all they want out of you with that determined vicious look in his eye I had to halfshut my eyes still he hasnt such a tremendous amount of spunk in him when I made him pull out and do it on me considering how big it is so much the better in case any of it wasnt washed out properly the last time I let him finish it in me nice invention they made for women for him to get all the pleasure but if someone gave them a touch of it themselves theyd know what I went through with Milly nobody would believe cutting her teeth too and Mina Purefoys husband give us a swing out of your whiskers filling her up with a child or twins once a year as regular as the clock always with a smell of children off her the one they called budgers or something like a nigger with a shock of hair on it Jesusjack the child is a black the last time I was there a squad of them falling over one another and bawling you couldnt hear your ears supposed to be healthy not satisfied till they have us swollen out like elephants or I dont know what supposing I risked having another not off him though still if he was married Im sure hed have a fine strong child but I dont know Poldy has more spunk in him yes thatd be awfully jolly I suppose it was meeting Josie Powell and the funeral and thinking about me and Boylan set him off well he can think what he likes now if thatll do him any good I know they were spooning a bit when I came on the scene he was dancing and sitting out with her the night of Georgina Simpsons housewarming and then he wanted to ram it down my neck it was on account of not liking to see her a wallflower that was why we had the standup row over politics he began it not me when he said about Our Lord being a carpenter at last he made me cry of course a woman is so sensitive about everything I was fuming with myself after for giving in only for I knew he was gone on me and the first socialist he said He was he annoyed me so much I couldnt put him into a temper still he knows a lot of mixedup things especially about the body and the inside I often wanted to study up that myself what we have inside us in that family physician I could always hear his voice talking when the room was crowded and watch him after that I pretended I had a coolness on with her over him because he used to be a bit on the jealous side whenever he asked who are you going to and I said over to Floey and he made me the present of Byrons poems and the three pairs of gloves so that finished that I could quite easily get him to make it up any time I know how Id even supposing he got in with her again and was going out to see her somewhere Id know if he refused to eat the onions I know plenty of ways ask him to tuck down the collar of my blouse or touch him with my veil and gloves on going out kiss then would send them all spinning however alright well see then let him go to her she of course would only be too delighted to pretend shes mad in love with him that I wouldnt so much mind Id just go to her and ask her do you love him and look her square in the eyes she couldnt fool me but he might imagine he was and make a declaration to her with his plabbery kind of a manner like he did to me though I had the devils own job to get it out of him though I liked him for that it showed he could hold in and wasnt to be got for the asking he was on the pop of asking me too the night in the kitchen I was rolling the potato cake theres something I want to say to you only for I put him off letting on I was in a temper with my hands and arms full of pasty flour in any case I let out too much the night before talking of dreams so I didnt want to let him know more than was good for him she used to be always embracing me Josie whenever he was there meaning him of course glauming me over and when I said I washed up and down as far as possible asking me and did you wash possible the women are always egging on to that putting it on thick when hes there they know by his sly eye blinking a bit putting on the indifferent when they come out with something the kind he is what spoils him I dont wonder in the least because he was very handsome at that time trying to look like Lord Byron I said I liked though he was too beautiful for a man and he was a little before we got engaged afterwards though she didnt like it so much the day I was in fits of laughing with the giggles I couldnt stop about all my hairpins falling out one after another with the mass of hair I had youre always in great humour she said yes because it grigged her because she knew what it meant because I used to tell her a good bit of what went on between us not all but just enough to make her mouth water but that wasnt my fault she didnt darken the door much after we were married I wonder what shes got like now after living with that dotty husband of hers she had her face beginning to look drawn and run down the last time I saw her she must have been just after a row with him because I saw on the moment she was edging to draw down a conversation about husbands and talk about him to run him down what was it she told me O yes that sometimes he used to go to bed with his muddy boots on when the maggot takes him just imagine having to get into bed with a thing like that that might murder you any moment what a man well its not the one way everyone goes mad Poldy anyhow whatever he does always wipes his feet on the mat when he comes in wet or shine and always blacks his own boots too and he always takes off his hat when he comes up in the street like then and now hes going about in his slippers to look for for a postcard U p up O sweetheart May wouldnt a thing like that simply bore you stiff to extinction actually too stupid even to take his boots off now what could you make of a man like that Id rather die times over than marry another of their sex of course hed never find another woman like me to put up with him the way I do know me come sleep with me yes and he knows that too at the bottom of his heart take that Mrs Maybrick that poisoned her husband for what I wonder in love with some other man yes it was found out on her wasnt she the downright villain to go and do a thing like that of course some men can be dreadfully aggravating drive you mad and always the worst word in the world what do they ask us to marry them for if were so bad as all that comes to yes because they cant get on without us white Arsenic she put in his tea off flypaper wasnt it I wonder why they call it that if I asked him hed say its from the Greek leave us as wise as we were before she must have been madly in love with the other fellow to run the chance of being hanged O she didnt care if that was her nature what could she do besides theyre not brutes enough to go and hang a woman surely are they theyre all so different Boylan talking about the shape of my foot he noticed at once even before he was introduced when I was in the D B C with Poldy laughing and trying to listen I was waggling my foot we both ordered teas and plain bread and butter I saw him looking with his two old maids of sisters when I stood up and asked the girl where it was what do I care with it dropping out of me and that black closed breeches he made me buy takes you half an hour to let them down wetting all myself always with some brandnew fad every other week such a long one I did I forgot my suede gloves on the seat behind that I never got after some robber of a woman and he wanted me to put it in the Irish times lost in the ladies lavatory D B C Dame street finder return to Mrs Marion Bloom and I saw his eyes on my feet going out through the turning door he was looking when I looked back and I went there for tea days after in the hope but he wasnt now how did that excite him because I was crossing them when we were in the other room first he meant the shoes that are too tight to walk in my hand is nice like that if I only had a ring with the stone for my month a nice aquamarine Ill stick him for one and a gold bracelet I dont like my foot so much still I made him spend once with my foot the night after Goodwins botchup of a concert so cold and windy it was well we had that rum in the house to mull and the fire wasnt black out when he asked to take off my stockings lying on the hearthrug in Lombard street west and another time it was my muddy boots hed like me to walk in all the horses dung I could find but of course hes not natural like the rest of the world that I what did he say I could give points in to Katty Lanner and beat her what does that mean I asked him I forget what he said because the stoppress edition just passed and the man with the curly hair in the Lucan dairy thats so polite I think I saw his face before somewhere I noticed him when I was tasting the butter so I took my time Bartell DArcy too that he used to make fun of when he commenced kissing me on the choir stairs after I sang Gounods what are we waiting for O my heart kiss me straight on the brow and part which is my brown part he was pretty hot for all his tinny voice too my low notes he was always raving about if you can believe him I liked the way he used his mouth singing then he said wasnt it terrible to do that there in a place like that I dont see anything so terrible about it Ill tell him about that some day not now and surprise him ay and Ill take him there and show him the very place too we did it so now there you are like it or lump it he thinks nothing can happen without him knowing he hadnt an idea about my mother till we were engaged otherwise hed never have got me so cheap as he did he was times worse himself anyhow begging me to give him a tiny bit cut off my drawers that was the evening coming along Kenilworth square he kissed me in the eye of my glove and I had to take it off asking me questions is it permitted to enquire the shape of my bedroom so I let him keep it as if I forgot it to think of me when I saw him slip it into his pocket of course hes mad on the subject of drawers thats plain to be seen always skeezing at those brazenfaced things on the bicycles with their skirts blowing up to their navels even when Milly and I were out with him at the open air fete that one in the cream muslin standing right against the sun so he could see every atom she had on when he saw me from behind following in the rain I saw him before he saw me however standing at the corner of the Harolds cross road with a new raincoat on him with the muffler in the Zingari colours to show off his complexion and the brown hat looking slyboots as usual what was he doing there where hed no business they can go and get whatever they like from anything at all with a skirt on it and were not to ask any questions but they want to know where were you where are you going I could feel him coming along skulking after me his eyes on my neck he had been keeping away from the house he felt it was getting too warm for him so I halfturned and stopped then he pestered me to say yes till I took off my glove slowly watching him he said my openwork sleeves were too cold for the rain anything for an excuse to put his hand anear me drawers drawers the whole blessed time till I promised to give him the pair off my doll to carry about in his waistcoat pocket Maria he did look a big fool dreeping in the rain splendid set of teeth he had made me hungry to look at them and beseeched of me to lift the orange petticoat I had on with the sunray pleats that there was nobody he said hed kneel down in the wet if I didnt so persevering he would too and ruin his new raincoat you never know what freak theyd take alone with you theyre so savage for it if anyone was passing so I lifted them a bit and touched his trousers outside the way I used to Gardner after with my ring hand to keep him from doing worse where it was too public I was dying to find out was he circumcised he was shaking like a jelly all over they want to do everything too quick take all the pleasure out of it and father waiting all the time for his dinner he told me to say I left my purse in the butchers and had to go back for it what a Deceiver then he wrote me that letter with all those words in it how could he have the face to any woman after his company manners making it so awkward after when we met asking me have I offended you with my eyelids down of course he saw I wasnt he had a few brains not like that other fool Henny Doyle he was always breaking or tearing something in the charades I hate an unlucky man and if I knew what it meant of course I had to say no for form sake dont understand you I said and wasnt it natural so it is of course it used to be written up with a picture of a womans on that wall in Gibraltar with that word I couldnt find anywhere only for children seeing it too young then writing every morning a letter sometimes twice a day I liked the way he made love then he knew the way to take a woman when he sent me the big poppies because mine was the th then I wrote the night he kissed my heart at Dolphins barn I couldnt describe it simply it makes you feel like nothing on earth but he never knew how to embrace well like Gardner I hope hell come on Monday as he said at the same time four I hate people who come at all hours answer the door you think its the vegetables then its somebody and you all undressed or the door of the filthy sloppy kitchen blows open the day old frostyface Goodwin called about the concert in Lombard street and I just after dinner all flushed and tossed with boiling old stew dont look at me professor I had to say Im a fright yes but he was a real old gent in his way it was impossible to be more respectful nobody to say youre out you have to peep out through the blind like the messengerboy today I thought it was a putoff first him sending the port and the peaches first and I was just beginning to yawn with nerves thinking he was trying to make a fool of me when I knew his tattarrattat at the door he must have been a bit late because it was after when I saw the Dedalus girls coming from school I never know the time even that watch he gave me never seems to go properly Id want to get it looked after when I threw the penny to that lame sailor for England home and beauty when I was whistling there is a charming girl I love and I hadnt even put on my clean shift or powdered myself or a thing then this day week were to go to Belfast just as well he has to go to Ennis his fathers anniversary the th it wouldnt be pleasant if he did suppose our rooms at the hotel were beside each other and any fooling went on in the new bed I couldnt tell him to stop and not bother me with him in the next room or perhaps some protestant clergyman with a cough knocking on the wall then hed never believe the next day we didnt do something its all very well a husband but you cant fool a lover after me telling him we never did anything of course he didnt believe me no its better hes going where he is besides something always happens with him the time going to the Mallow concert at Maryborough ordering boiling soup for the two of us then the bell rang out he walks down the platform with the soup splashing about taking spoonfuls of it hadnt he the nerve and the waiter after him making a holy show of us screeching and confusion for the engine to start but he wouldnt pay till he finished it the two gentlemen in the rd class carriage said he was quite right so he was too hes so pigheaded sometimes when he gets a thing into his head a good job he was able to open the carriage door with his knife or theyd have taken us on to Cork I suppose that was done out of revenge on him O I love jaunting in a train or a car with lovely soft cushions I wonder will he take a st class for me he might want to do it in the train by tipping the guard well O I suppose therell be the usual idiots of men gaping at us with their eyes as stupid as ever they can possibly be that was an exceptional man that common workman that left us alone in the carriage that day going to Howth Id like to find out something about him or tunnels perhaps then you have to look out of the window all the nicer then coming back suppose I never came back what would they say eloped with him that gets you on on the stage the last concert I sang at where its over a year ago when was it St Teresas hall Clarendon St little chits of missies they have now singing Kathleen Kearney and her like on account of father being in the army and my singing the absentminded beggar and wearing a brooch for Lord Roberts when I had the map of it all and Poldy not Irish enough was it him managed it this time I wouldnt put it past him like he got me on to sing in the by going around saying he was putting Lead Kindly Light to music I put him up to that till the jesuits found out he was a freemason thumping the piano lead Thou me on copied from some old opera yes and he was going about with some of them Sinner Fein lately or whatever they call themselves talking his usual trash and nonsense he says that little man he showed me without the neck is very intelligent the coming man Griffiths is he well he doesnt look it thats all I can say still it must have been him he knew there was a boycott I hate the mention of their politics after the war that Pretoria and Ladysmith and Bloemfontein where Gardner lieut Stanley G th Bn nd East Lancs Rgt of enteric fever he was a lovely fellow in khaki and just the right height over me Im sure he was brave too he said I was lovely the evening we kissed goodbye at the canal lock my Irish beauty he was pale with excitement about going away or wed be seen from the road he couldnt stand properly and I so hot as I never felt they could have made their peace in the beginning or old oom Paul and the rest of the other old Krugers go and fight it out between them instead of dragging on for years killing any finelooking men there were with their fever if he was even decently shot it wouldnt have been so bad I love to see a regiment pass in review the first time I saw the Spanish cavalry at La Roque it was lovely after looking across the bay from Algeciras all the lights of the rock like fireflies or those sham battles on the acres the Black Watch with their kilts in time at the march past the th hussars the prince of Wales own or the lancers O the lancers theyre grand or the Dublins that won Tugela his father made his money over selling the horses for the cavalry well he could buy me a nice present up in Belfast after what I gave him theyve lovely linen up there or one of those nice kimono things I must buy a mothball like I had before to keep in the drawer with them it would be exciting going round with him shopping buying those things in a new city better leave this ring behind want to keep turning and turning to get it over the knuckle there or they might bell it round the town in their papers or tell the police on me but theyd think were married O let them all go and smother themselves for the fat lot I care he has plenty of money and hes not a marrying man so somebody better get it out of him if I could find out whether he likes me I looked a bit washy of course when I looked close in the handglass powdering a mirror never gives you the expression besides scrooching down on me like that all the time with his big hipbones hes heavy too with his hairy chest for this heat always having to lie down for them better for him put it into me from behind the way Mrs Mastiansky told me her husband made her like the dogs do it and stick out her tongue as far as ever she could and he so quiet and mild with his tingating cither can you ever be up to men the way it takes them lovely stuff in that blue suit he had on and stylish tie and socks with the skyblue silk things on them hes certainly welloff I know by the cut his clothes have and his heavy watch but he was like a perfect devil for a few minutes after he came back with the stoppress tearing up the tickets and swearing blazes because he lost quid he said he lost over that outsider that won and half he put on for me on account of Lenehans tip cursing him to the lowest pits that sponger he was making free with me after the Glencree dinner coming back that long joult over the featherbed mountain after the lord Mayor looking at me with his dirty eyes Val Dillon that big heathen I first noticed him at dessert when I was cracking the nuts with my teeth I wished I could have picked every morsel of that chicken out of my fingers it was so tasty and browned and as tender as anything only for I didnt want to eat everything on my plate those forks and fishslicers were hallmarked silver too I wish I had some I could easily have slipped a couple into my muff when I was playing with them then always hanging out of them for money in a restaurant for the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him Ill know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose Ill only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at the cleaners whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the years more I have of life up to no Im what am I at all Ill be in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Burns as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were yes I think he made them a bit firmer sucking them like that so long he made me thirsty titties he calls them I had to laugh yes this one anyhow stiff the nipple gets for the least thing Ill get him to keep that up and Ill take those eggs beaten up with marsala fatten them out for him what are all those veins and things curious the way its made the same in case of twins theyre supposed to represent beauty placed up there like those statues in the museum one of them pretending to hide it with her hand are they so beautiful of course compared with what a man looks like with his two bags full and his other thing hanging down out of him or sticking up at you like a hatrack no wonder they hide it with a cabbageleaf that disgusting Cameron highlander behind the meat market or that other wretch with the red head behind the tree where the statue of the fish used to be when I was passing pretending he was pissing standing out for me to see it with his babyclothes up to one side the Queens own they were a nice lot its well the Surreys relieved them theyre always trying to show it to you every time nearly I passed outside the mens greenhouse near the Harcourt street station just to try some fellow or other trying to catch my eye as if it was of the wonders of the world O and the stink of those rotten places the night coming home with Poldy after the Comerfords party oranges and lemonade to make you feel nice and watery I went into of them it was so biting cold I couldnt keep it when was that the canal was frozen yes it was a few months after a pity a couple of the Camerons werent there to see me squatting in the mens place meadero I tried to draw a picture of it before I tore it up like a sausage or something I wonder theyre not afraid going about of getting a kick or a bang of something there the woman is beauty of course thats admitted when he said I could pose for a picture naked to some rich fellow in Holles street when he lost the job in Helys and I was selling the clothes and strumming in the coffee palace would I be like that bath of the nymph with my hair down yes only shes younger or Im a little like that dirty bitch in that Spanish photo he has nymphs used they go about like that I asked him about her and that word met something with hoses in it and he came out with some jawbreakers about the incarnation he never can explain a thing simply the way a body can understand then he goes and burns the bottom out of the pan all for his Kidney this one not so much theres the mark of his teeth still where he tried to bite the nipple I had to scream out arent they fearful trying to hurt you I had a great breast of milk with Milly enough for two what was the reason of that he said I could have got a pound a week as a wet nurse all swelled out the morning that delicate looking student that stopped in no with the Citrons Penrose nearly caught me washing through the window only for I snapped up the towel to my face that was his studenting hurt me they used to weaning her till he got doctor Brady to give me the belladonna prescription I had to get him to suck them they were so hard he said it was sweeter and thicker than cows then he wanted to milk me into the tea well hes beyond everything I declare somebody ought to put him in the budget if I only could remember the one half of the things and write a book out of it the works of Master Poldy yes and its so much smoother the skin much an hour he was at them Im sure by the clock like some kind of a big infant I had at me they want everything in their mouth all the pleasure those men get out of a woman I can feel his mouth O Lord I must stretch myself I wished he was here or somebody to let myself go with and come again like that I feel all fire inside me or if I could dream it when he made me spend the nd time tickling me behind with his finger I was coming for about minutes with my legs round him I had to hug him after O Lord I wanted to shout out all sorts of things fuck or shit or anything at all only not to look ugly or those lines from the strain who knows the way hed take it you want to feel your way with a man theyre not all like him thank God some of them want you to be so nice about it I noticed the contrast he does it and doesnt talk I gave my eyes that look with my hair a bit loose from the tumbling and my tongue between my lips up to him the savage brute Thursday Friday one Saturday two Sunday three O Lord I cant wait till Monday frseeeeeeeefronnnng train somewhere whistling the strength those engines have in them like big giants and the water rolling all over and out of them all sides like the end of Loves old sweeeetsonnnng the poor men that have to be out all the night from their wives and families in those roasting engines stifling it was today Im glad I burned the half of those old Freemans and Photo Bits leaving things like that lying about hes getting very careless and threw the rest of them up in the W C I ll get him to cut them tomorrow for me instead of having them there for the next year to get a few pence for them have him asking wheres last Januarys paper and all those old overcoats I bundled out of the hall making the place hotter than it is that rain was lovely and refreshing just after my beauty sleep I thought it was going to get like Gibraltar my goodness the heat there before the levanter came on black as night and the glare of the rock standing up in it like a big giant compared with their Rock mountain they think is so great with the red sentries here and there the poplars and they all whitehot and the smell of the rainwater in those tanks watching the sun all the time weltering down on you faded all that lovely frock fathers friend Mrs Stanhope sent me from the B Marche paris what a shame my dearest Doggerina she wrote on it she was very nice whats this her other name was just a p c to tell you I sent the little present have just had a jolly warm bath and feel a very clean dog now enjoyed it wogger she called him wogger wd give anything to be back in Gib and hear you sing Waiting and in old Madrid Concone is the name of those exercises he bought me one of those new some word I couldnt make out shawls amusing things but tear for the least thing still there lovely I think dont you will always think of the lovely teas we had together scrumptious currant scones and raspberry wafers I adore well now dearest Doggerina be sure and write soon kind she left out regards to your father also Captain Grove with love yrs affly Hester x x x x x she didnt look a bit married just like a girl he was years older than her wogger he was awfully fond of me when he held down the wire with his foot for me to step over at the bullfight at La Linea when that matador Gomez was given the bulls ear these clothes we have to wear whoever invented them expecting you to walk up Killiney hill then for example at that picnic all staysed up you cant do a blessed thing in them in a crowd run or jump out of the way thats why I was afraid when that other ferocious old Bull began to charge the banderilleros with the sashes and the things in their hats and the brutes of men shouting bravo toro sure the women were as bad in their nice white mantillas ripping all the whole insides out of those poor horses I never heard of such a thing in all my life yes he used to break his heart at me taking off the dog barking in bell lane poor brute and it sick what became of them ever I suppose theyre dead long ago the of them its like all through a mist makes you feel so old I made the scones of course I had everything all to myself then a girl Hester we used to compare our hair mine was thicker than hers she showed me how to settle it at the back when I put it up and whats this else how to make a knot on a thread with the one hand we were like cousins what age was I then the night of the storm I slept in her bed she had her arms round me then we were fighting in the morning with the pillow what fun he was watching me whenever he got an opportunity at the band on the Alameda esplanade when I was with father and Captain Grove I looked up at the church first and then at the windows then down and our eyes met I felt something go through me like all needles my eyes were dancing I remember after when I looked at myself in the glass hardly recognised myself the change he was attractive to a girl in spite of his being a little bald intelligent looking disappointed and gay at the same time he was like Thomas in the shadow of Ashlydyat I had a splendid skin from the sun and the excitement like a rose I didnt get a wink of sleep it wouldnt have been nice on account of her but I could have stopped it in time she gave me the Moonstone to read that was the first I read of Wilkie Collins East Lynne I read and the shadow of Ashlydyat Mrs Henry Wood Henry Dunbar by that other woman I lent him afterwards with Mulveys photo in it so as he see I wasnt without and Lord Lytton Eugene Aram Molly bawn she gave me by Mrs Hungerford on account of the name I dont like books with a Molly in them like that one he brought me about the one from Flanders a whore always shoplifting anything she could cloth and stuff and yards of it O this blanket is too heavy on me thats better I havent even one decent nightdress this thing gets all rolled under me besides him and his fooling thats better I used to be weltering then in the heat my shift drenched with the sweat stuck in the cheeks of my bottom on the chair when I stood up they were so fattish and firm when I got up on the sofa cushions to see with my clothes up and the bugs tons of them at night and the mosquito nets I couldnt read a line Lord how long ago it seems centuries of course they never came back and she didnt put her address right on it either she may have noticed her wogger people were always going away and we never I remember that day with the waves and the boats with their high heads rocking and the smell of ship those Officers uniforms on shore leave made me seasick he didnt say anything he was very serious I had the high buttoned boots on and my skirt was blowing she kissed me six or seven times didnt I cry yes I believe I did or near it my lips were taittering when I said goodbye she had a Gorgeous wrap of some special kind of blue colour on her for the voyage made very peculiarly to one side like and it was extremely pretty it got as dull as the devil after they went I was almost planning to run away mad out of it somewhere were never easy where we are father or aunt or marriage waiting always waiting to guiiiide him toooo me waiting nor speeeed his flying feet their damn guns bursting and booming all over the shop especially the Queens birthday and throwing everything down in all directions if you didnt open the windows when general Ulysses Grant whoever he was or did supposed to be some great fellow landed off the ship and old Sprague the consul that was there from before the flood dressed up poor man and he in mourning for the son then the same old bugles for reveille in the morning and drums rolling and the unfortunate poor devils of soldiers walking about with messtins smelling the place more than the old longbearded jews in their jellibees and levites assembly and sound clear and gunfire for the men to cross the lines and the warden marching with his keys to lock the gates and the bagpipes and only captain Groves and father talking about Rorkes drift and Plevna and sir Garnet Wolseley and Gordon at Khartoum lighting their pipes for them everytime they went out drunken old devil with his grog on the windowsill catch him leaving any of it picking his nose trying to think of some other dirty story to tell up in a corner but he never forgot himself when I was there sending me out of the room on some blind excuse paying his compliments the Bushmills whisky talking of course but hed do the same to the next woman that came along I suppose he died of galloping drink ages ago the days like years not a letter from a living soul except the odd few I posted to myself with bits of paper in them so bored sometimes I could fight with my nails listening to that old Arab with the one eye and his heass of an instrument singing his heah heah aheah all my compriment on your hotchapotch of your heass as bad as now with the hands hanging off me looking out of the window if there was a nice fellow

sight less than the bulls and cows they were selling the meat and the coalmans bell that noisy bugger trying to swindle me with the wrong bill he took out of his hat what a pair of paws and pots and pans and kettles to mend any broken bottles for a poor man today and no visitors or post ever except his cheques or some advertisement like that wonderworker they sent him addressed dear Madam only

Mulveys was the first when I was in bed that morning and Mrs Rubio brought it in with the coffee she stood there standing when I asked her to hand me and I pointing at them I couldnt think of the word a hairpin to open it with ah horquilla disobliging old thing and it staring her in the face with her switch of false hair on her and vain about her appearance ugly as she was near or a her face a mass of wrinkles with all her religion domineering because she never could get over the Atlantic fleet coming in half the ships of the world and the Union Jack flying with all her carabineros because drunken English sailors took all the rock from them and because I didnt run into mass often enough in Santa Maria to please her with her shawl up on her except when there was a marriage on with all her miracles of the saints and her black blessed virgin with the silver dress and the sun dancing times on Easter Sunday morning and when the priest was going by with the bell bringing the vatican to the dying blessing herself for his Majestad an admirer he signed it I near jumped out of my skin I wanted to pick him up when I saw him following me along the Calle Real in the shop window then he tipped me just in passing but I never thought hed write making an appointment I had it inside my petticoat bodice all day reading it up in every hole and corner while father was up at the drill instructing to find out by the handwriting or the language of stamps singing I remember shall I wear a white rose and I wanted to put on the old stupid clock to near the time he was the first man kissed me under the Moorish wall my sweetheart when a boy it never entered my head what kissing meant till he put his tongue in my mouth his mouth was sweetlike young I put my knee up to him a few times to learn the way what did I tell him I was engaged for for fun to the son of a Spanish nobleman named Don Miguel de la Flora and he believed me that I was to be married to him in years time theres many a true word spoken in jest there is a flower that bloometh a few things I told him true about myself just for him to be imagining the Spanish girls he didnt like I suppose one of them wouldnt have him I got him excited he crushed all the flowers on my bosom he brought me he couldnt count the pesetas and the perragordas till I taught him Cappoquin he came from he said on the black water but it was too short then the day before he left May yes it was May when the infant king of Spain was born Im always like that in the spring Id like a new fellow every year up on the tiptop under the rockgun near OHaras tower I told him it was struck by lightning and all about the old Barbary apes they sent to Clapham without a tail careering all over the show on each others back Mrs Rubio said she was a regular old rock scorpion robbing the chickens out of Inces farm and throw stones at you if you went anear he was looking at me I had that white blouse on open in the front to encourage him as much as I could without too openly they were just beginning to be plump I said I was tired we lay over the firtree cove a wild place I suppose it must be the highest rock in existence the galleries and casemates and those frightful rocks and Saint Michaels cave with the icicles or whatever they call them hanging down and ladders all the mud plotching my boots Im sure thats the way down the monkeys go under the sea to Africa when they die the ships out far like chips that was the Malta boat passing yes the sea and the sky you could do what you liked lie there for ever he caressed them outside they love doing that its the roundness there I was leaning over him with my white ricestraw hat to take the newness out of it the left side of my face the best my blouse open for his last day transparent kind of shirt he had I could see his chest pink he wanted to touch mine with his for a moment but I wouldnt let him he was awfully put out first for fear you never know consumption or leave me with a child embarazada that old servant Ines told me that one drop even if it got into you at all after I tried with the Banana but I was afraid it might break and get lost up in me somewhere because they once took something down out of a woman that was up there for years covered with limesalts theyre all mad to get in there where they come out of youd think they could never go far enough up and then theyre done with you in a way till the next time yes because theres a wonderful feeling there so tender all the time how did we finish it off yes O yes I pulled him off into my handkerchief pretending not to be excited but I opened my legs I wouldnt let him touch me inside my petticoat because I had a skirt opening up the side I tormented the life out of him first tickling him I loved rousing that dog in the hotel rrrsssstt awokwokawok his eyes shut and a bird flying below us he was shy all the same I liked him like that moaning I made him blush a little when I got over him that way when I unbuttoned him and took his out and drew back the skin it had a kind of eye in it theyre all Buttons men down the middle on the wrong side of them Molly darling he called me what was his name Jack Joe Harry Mulvey was it yes I think a lieutenant he was rather fair he had a laughing kind of a voice so I went round to the whatyoucallit everything was whatyoucallit moustache had he he said hed come back Lord its just like yesterday to me and if I was married hed do it to me and I promised him yes faithfully Id let him block me now flying perhaps hes dead or killed or a captain or admiral its nearly years if I said firtree cove he would if he came up behind me and put his hands over my eyes to guess who I might recognise him hes young still about perhaps hes married some girl on the black water and is quite changed they all do they havent half the character a woman has she little knows what I did with her beloved husband before he ever dreamt of her in broad daylight too in the sight of the whole world you might say they could have put an article about it in the Chronicle I was a bit wild after when I blew out the old bag the biscuits were in from Benady Bros and exploded it Lord what a bang all the woodcocks and pigeons screaming coming back the same way that we went over middle hill round by the old guardhouse and the jews burialplace pretending to read out the Hebrew on them I wanted to fire his pistol he said he hadnt one he didnt know what to make of me with his peak cap on that he always wore crooked as often as I settled it straight H M S Calypso swinging my hat that old Bishop that spoke off the altar his long preach about womans higher functions about girls now riding the bicycle and wearing peak caps and the new woman bloomers God send him sense and me more money I suppose theyre called after him I never thought that would be my name Bloom when I used to write it in print to see how it looked on a visiting card or practising for the butcher and oblige M Bloom youre looking blooming Josie used to say after I married him well its better than Breen or Briggs does brig or those awful names with bottom in them Mrs Ramsbottom or some other kind of a bottom Mulvey I wouldnt go mad about either or suppose I divorced him Mrs Boylan my mother whoever she was might have given me a nicer name the Lord knows after the lovely one she had Lunita Laredo the fun we had running along Williss road to Europa point twisting in and out all round the other side of Jersey they were shaking and dancing about in my blouse like Millys little ones now when she runs up the stairs I loved looking down at them I was jumping up at the pepper trees and the white poplars pulling the leaves off and throwing them at him he went to India he was to write the voyages those men have to make to the ends of the world and back its the least they might get a squeeze or two at a woman while they can going out to be drowned or blown up somewhere I went up Windmill hill to the flats that Sunday morning with captain Rubios that was dead spyglass like the sentry had he said hed have one or two from on board I wore that frock from the B Marche paris and the coral necklace the straits shining I could see over to Morocco almost the bay of Tangier white and the Atlas mountain with snow on it and the straits like a river so clear Harry Molly darling I was thinking of him on the sea all the time after at mass when my petticoat began to slip down at the elevation weeks and weeks I kept the handkerchief under my pillow for the smell of him there was no decent perfume to be got in that Gibraltar only that cheap peau dEspagne that faded and left a stink on you more than anything else I wanted to give him a memento he gave me that clumsy Claddagh ring for luck that I gave Gardner going to south Africa where those Boers killed him with their war and fever but they were well beaten all the same as if it brought its bad luck with it like an opal or pearl still it must have been pure carrot gold because it was very heavy but what could you get in a place like that the sandfrog shower from Africa and that derelict ship that came up to the harbour Marie the Marie whatyoucallit no he hadnt a moustache that was Gardner yes I can see his face cleanshaven Frseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeefrong that train again weeping tone once in the dear

bit on my side piano quietly sweeeee theres that train far away pianissimo eeeee one more song that was a relief wherever you be let your wind go free who knows if that pork chop I took with my cup of tea after was quite good with the heat I couldnt smell anything off it Im sure that queerlooking man in the porkbutchers is a great rogue I hope that lamp is not smoking fill my nose up with smuts better than having him leaving the gas on all night I couldnt rest easy in my bed in Gibraltar even getting up to see why am I so damned nervous about that though I like it in the winter its more company O Lord it was rotten cold too that winter when I was only about ten was I yes I had the big doll with all the funny clothes dressing her up and undressing that icy wind skeeting across from those mountains the something Nevada sierra nevada standing at the fire with the little bit of a short shift I had up to heat myself I loved dancing about in it then make a race back into bed Im sure that fellow opposite used to be there the whole time watching with the lights out in the summer and I in my skin hopping around I used to love myself then stripped at the washstand dabbing and creaming only when it came to the chamber performance I put out the light too so then there were of us goodbye to my sleep for this night anyhow I hope hes not going to get in with those medicals leading him astray to imagine hes young again coming in at in the morning it must be if not more still he had the manners not to wake me what do they find to gabber about all night squandering money and getting drunker and drunker couldnt they drink water then he starts giving us his orders for eggs and tea and Findon haddy and hot buttered toast I suppose well have him sitting up like the king of the country pumping the wrong end of the spoon up and down in his egg wherever he learned that from and I love to hear him falling up the stairs of a morning with the cups rattling on the tray and then play with the cat she rubs up against you for her own sake I wonder has she fleas shes as bad as a woman always licking and lecking but I hate their claws I wonder do they see anything that we cant staring like that when she sits at the top of the stairs so long and listening as I wait always what a robber too that lovely fresh plaice I bought I think Ill get a bit of fish tomorrow or today is it Friday yes I will with some blancmange with black currant jam like long ago not those lb pots of mixed plum and apple from the London and Newcastle Williams and Woods goes twice as far only for the bones I hate those eels cod yes Ill get a nice piece of cod Im always getting enough for forgetting anyway Im sick of that everlasting butchers meat from Buckleys loin chops and leg beef and rib steak and scrag of mutton and calfs pluck the very name is enough or a picnic suppose we all gave each and or let him pay it and invite some other woman for him who Mrs Fleming and drove out to the furry glen or the strawberry beds wed have him examining all the horses toenails first like he does with the letters no not with Boylan there yes with some cold veal and ham mixed sandwiches there are little houses down at the bottom of the banks there on purpose but its as hot as blazes he says not a bank holiday anyhow I hate those ruck of Mary Ann coalboxes out for the day Whit Monday is a cursed day too no wonder that bee bit him better the seaside but Id never again in this life get into a boat with him after him at Bray telling the boatman he knew how to row if anyone asked could he ride the steeplechase for the gold cup hed say yes then it came on to get rough the old thing crookeding about and the weight all down my side telling me pull the right reins now pull the left and the tide all swamping in floods in through the bottom and his oar slipping out of the stirrup its a mercy we werent all drowned he can swim of course me no theres no danger whatsoever keep yourself calm in his flannel trousers Id like to have tattered them down off him before all the people and give him what that one calls flagellate till he was black and blue do him all the good in the world only for that longnosed chap I dont know who he is with that other beauty Burke out of the City Arms hotel was there spying around as usual on the slip always where he wasnt wanted if there was a row on youd vomit a better face there was no love lost between us thats consolation I wonder what kind is that book he brought me Sweets of Sin by a gentleman of fashion some other Mr de Kock I suppose the people gave him that nickname going about with his tube from one woman to another I couldnt even change my new white shoes all ruined with the saltwater and the hat I had with that feather all blowy and tossed on me how annoying and provoking because the smell of the sea excited me of course the sardines and the bream in Catalan bay round the back of the rock they were fine all silver in the fishermens baskets old Luigi near a hundred they said came from Genoa and the tall old chap with the earrings I dont like a man you have to climb up to to get at I suppose theyre all dead and rotten long ago besides I dont like being alone in this big barracks of a place at night I suppose Ill have to put up with it I never brought a bit of salt in even when we moved in the confusion musical academy he was going to make on the first floor drawingroom with a brassplate or Blooms private hotel he suggested go and ruin himself altogether the way his father did down in Ennis like all the things he told father he was going to do and me but I saw through him telling me all the lovely places we could go for the honeymoon Venice by moonlight with the gondolas and the lake of Como he had a picture cut out of some paper of and mandolines and lanterns O how nice I said whatever I liked he was going to do immediately if not sooner will you be my man will you carry my can he ought to get a leather medal with a putty rim for all the plans he invents then leaving us here all day youd never know what old beggar at the door for a crust with his long story might be a tramp and put his foot in the way to prevent me shutting it like that picture of that hardened criminal he was called in Lloyds Weekly news years in jail then he comes out and murders an old woman for her money imagine his poor wife or mother or whoever she is such a face youd run miles away from I couldnt rest easy till I bolted all the doors and windows to make sure but its worse again being locked up like in a prison or a madhouse they ought to be all shot or the cat of nine tails a big brute like that that would attack a poor old woman to murder her in her bed Id cut them off him so I would not that hed be much use still better than nothing the night I was sure I heard burglars in the kitchen and he went down in his shirt with a candle and a poker as if he was looking for a mouse as white as a sheet frightened out of his wits making as much noise as he possibly could for the burglars benefit there isnt much to steal indeed the Lord knows still its the feeling especially now with Milly away such an idea for him to send the girl down there to learn to take photographs on account of his grandfather instead of sending her to Skerrys academy where shed have to learn not like me getting all at school only hed do a thing like that all the same on account of me and Boylan thats why he did it Im certain the way he plots and plans everything out I couldnt turn round with her in the place lately unless I bolted the door first gave me the fidgets coming in without knocking first when I put the chair against the door just as I was washing myself there below with the glove get on your nerves then doing the loglady all day put her in a glasscase with two at a time to look at her if he knew she broke off the hand off that little gimcrack statue with her roughness and carelessness before she left that I got that little Italian boy to mend so that you cant see the join for shillings wouldnt even teem the potatoes for you of course shes right not to ruin her hands I noticed he was always talking to her lately at the table explaining things in the paper and she pretending to understand sly of course that comes from his side of the house he cant say I pretend things can he Im too honest as a matter of fact and helping her into her coat but if there was anything wrong with her its me shed tell not him I suppose he thinks Im finished out and laid on the shelf well Im not no nor anything like it well see well see now shes well on for flirting too with Tom Devans two sons imitating me whistling with those romps of Murray girls calling for her can Milly come out please shes in great demand to pick what they can out of her round in Nelson street riding Harry Devans bicycle at night its as well he sent her where she is she was just getting out of bounds wanting to go on the skatingrink and smoking their cigarettes through their nose I smelt it off her dress when I was biting off the thread of the button I sewed on to the bottom of her jacket she couldnt hide much from me I tell you only I oughtnt to have stitched it and it on her it brings a parting and the last plumpudding too split in halves see it comes out no matter what they say her tongue is a bit too long for my taste your blouse is open too low she says to me the pan calling the kettle blackbottom and I had to tell her not to cock her legs up like that on show on the windowsill before all the people passing they all look at her like me when I was her age of course any old rag looks well on you then a great touchmenot too in her own way at the Only Way in the Theatre royal take your foot away out of that I hate people touching me afraid of her life Id crush her skirt with the pleats a lot of that touching must go on in theatres in the crush in the dark theyre always trying to wiggle up to you that fellow in the pit at the Gaiety for Beerbohm Tree in Trilby the last time Ill ever go there to be squashed like that for any Trilby or her barebum every two minutes tipping me there and looking away hes a bit daft I think I saw him after trying to get near two stylishdressed ladies outside Switzers window at the same little game I recognised him on the moment the face and everything but he didnt remember me yes and she didnt even want me to kiss her at the Broadstone going away well I hope shell get someone to dance attendance on her the way I did when she was down with the mumps and her glands swollen wheres this and wheres that of course she cant feel anything deep yet I never came properly till I was what or so it went into the wrong place always only the usual girls nonsense and giggling that Conny Connolly writing to her in white ink on black paper sealed with sealingwax though she clapped when the curtain came down because he looked so handsome then we had Martin Harvey for breakfast dinner and supper I thought to myself afterwards it must be real love if a man gives up his life for her that way for nothing I suppose there are a few men like that left its hard to believe in it though unless it really happened to me the majority of them with not a particle of love in their natures to find two people like that nowadays full up of each other that would feel the same way as you do theyre usually a bit foolish in the head his father must have been a bit queer to go and poison himself after her still poor old man I suppose he felt lost shes always making love to my things too the few old rags I have wanting to put her hair up at my powder too only ruin her skin on her shes time enough for that all her life after of course shes restless knowing shes pretty with her lips so red a pity they wont stay that way I was too but theres no use going to the fair with the thing answering me like a fishwoman when I asked to go for a half a stone of potatoes the day we met Mrs Joe Gallaher at the trottingmatches and she pretended not to see us in her trap with Friery the solicitor we werent grand enough till I gave her damn fine cracks across the ear for herself take that now for answering me like that and that for your impudence she had me that exasperated of course contradicting I was badtempered too because how was it there was a weed in the tea or I didnt sleep the night before cheese I ate was it and I told her over and over again not to leave knives crossed like that because she has nobody to command her as she said herself well if he doesnt correct her faith I will that was the last time she turned on the teartap I was just like that myself they darent order me about the place its his fault of course having the two of us slaving here instead of getting in a woman long ago am I ever going to have a proper servant again of course then shed see him coming Id have to let her know or shed revenge it arent they a nuisance that old Mrs Fleming you have to be walking round after her putting the things into her hands sneezing and farting into the pots well of course shes old she cant help it a good job I found that rotten old smelly dishcloth that got lost behind the dresser I knew there was something and opened the area window to let out the smell bringing in his friends to entertain them like the night he walked home with a dog if you please that might have been mad especially Simon Dedalus son his father such a criticiser with his glasses up with his tall hat on him at the cricket match and a great big hole in his sock one thing laughing at the other and his son that got all those prizes for whatever he won them in the intermediate imagine climbing over the railings if anybody saw him that knew us I wonder he didnt tear a big hole in his grand funeral trousers as if the one nature gave wasnt enough for anybody hawking him down into the dirty old kitchen now is he right in his head I ask pity it wasnt washing day my old pair of drawers might have been hanging up too on the line on exhibition for all hed ever care with the ironmould mark the stupid old bundle burned on them he might think was something else and she never even rendered down the fat I told her and now shes going such as she was on account of her paralysed husband getting worse theres always something wrong with them disease or they have to go under an operation or if its not that its drink and he beats her Ill have to hunt around again for someone every day I get up theres some new thing on sweet God sweet God well when Im stretched out dead in my grave I suppose Ill have some peace I want to get up a minute if Im let wait O Jesus wait yes that thing has come on me yes now wouldnt that afflict you of course all the poking and rooting and ploughing he had up in me now what am I to do Friday Saturday Sunday wouldnt that pester the soul out of a body unless he likes it some men do God knows theres always something wrong with us days every or weeks usual monthly auction isnt it simply sickening that night it came on me like that the one and only time we were in a box that Michael Gunn gave him to see Mrs Kendal and her husband at the Gaiety something he did about insurance for him in Drimmies I was fit to be tied though I wouldnt give in with that gentleman of fashion staring down at me with his glasses and him the other side of me talking about Spinoza and his soul thats dead I suppose millions of years ago I smiled the best I could all in a swamp leaning forward as if I was interested having to sit it out then to the last tag I wont forget that wife of Scarli in a hurry supposed to be a fast play about adultery that idiot in the gallery hissing the woman adulteress he shouted I suppose he went and had a woman in the next lane running round all the back ways after to make up for it I wish he had what I had then hed boo I bet the cat itself is better off than us have we too much blood up in us or what O patience above its pouring out of me like the sea anyhow he didnt make me pregnant as big as he is I dont want to ruin the clean sheets I just put on I suppose the clean linen I wore brought it on too damn it damn it and they always want to see a stain on the bed to know youre a virgin for them all thats troubling them theyre such fools too you could be a widow or divorced times over a daub of red ink would do or blackberry juice no thats too purply O Jamesy let me up out of this pooh sweets of sin whoever suggested that business for women what between clothes and cooking and children this damned old bed too jingling like the dickens I suppose they could hear us away over the other side of the park till I suggested to put the quilt on the floor with the pillow under my bottom I wonder is it nicer in the day I think it is easy I think Ill cut all this hair off me there scalding me I might look like a young girl wouldnt he get the great suckin the next time he turned up my clothes on me Id give anything to see his face wheres the chamber gone easy Ive a holy horror of its breaking under me after that old commode I wonder was I too heavy sitting on his knee I made him sit on the easychair purposely when I took off only my blouse and skirt first in the other room he was so busy where he oughtnt to be he never felt me I hope my breath was sweet after those kissing comfits easy God I remember one time I could scout it out straight whistling like a man almost easy O Lord how noisy I hope theyre bubbles on it for a wad of money from some fellow Ill have to perfume it in the morning dont forget I bet he never saw a better pair of thighs than that look how white they are the smoothest place is right there between this bit here how soft like a peach easy God I wouldnt mind being a man and get up on a lovely woman O Lord what a row youre making like the jersey lily easy easy O how the waters come down at Lahore who knows is there anything the matter with my insides or have I something growing in me getting that thing like that every week when was it last I Whit Monday yes its only about weeks I ought to go to the doctor only it would be like before I married him when I had that white thing coming from me and Floey made me go to that dry old stick Dr Collins for womens diseases on Pembroke road your vagina he called it I suppose thats how he got all the gilt mirrors and carpets getting round those rich ones off Stephens green running up to him for every little fiddlefaddle her vagina and her cochinchina theyve money of course so theyre all right I wouldnt marry him not if he was the last man in the world besides theres something queer about their children always smelling around those filthy bitches all sides asking me if what I did had an offensive odour what did he want me to do but the one thing gold maybe what a question if I smathered it all over his wrinkly old face for him with all my compriments I suppose hed know then and could you pass it easily pass what I thought he was talking about the rock of Gibraltar the way he put it thats a very nice invention too by the way only I like letting myself down after in the hole as far as I can squeeze and pull the chain then to flush it nice cool pins and needles still theres something in it I suppose I always used to know by Millys when she was a child whether she had worms or not still all the same paying him for that how much is that doctor one guinea please and asking me had I frequent omissions where do those old fellows get all the words they have omissions with his shortsighted eyes on me cocked sideways I wouldnt trust him too far to give me chloroform or God knows what else still I liked him when he sat down to write the thing out frowning so severe his nose intelligent like that you be damned you lying strap O anything no matter who except an idiot he was clever enough to spot that of course that was all thinking of him and his mad crazy letters my Precious one everything connected with your glorious Body everything underlined that comes from it is a thing of beauty and of joy for ever something he got out of some nonsensical book that he had me always at myself and times a day sometimes and I said I hadnt are you sure O yes I said I am quite sure in a way that shut him up I knew what was coming next only natural weakness it was he excited me I dont know how the first night ever we met when I was living in Rehoboth terrace we stood staring at one another for about minutes as if we met somewhere I suppose on account of my being jewess looking after my mother he used to amuse me the things he said with the half sloothering smile on him and all the Doyles said he was going to stand for a member of Parliament O wasnt I the born fool to believe all his blather about home rule and the land league sending me that long strool of a song out of the Huguenots to sing in French to be more classy O beau pays de la Touraine that I never even sang once explaining and rigmaroling about religion and persecution he wont let you enjoy anything naturally then might he as a great favour the very st opportunity he got a chance in Brighton square running into my bedroom pretending the ink got on his hands to wash it off with the Albion milk and sulphur soap I used to use and the gelatine still round it O I laughed myself sick at him that day I better not make an alnight sitting on this affair they ought to make chambers a natural size so that a woman could sit on it properly he kneels down to do it I suppose there isnt in all creation another man with the habits he has look at the way hes sleeping at the foot of the bed how can he without a hard bolster its well he doesnt kick or he might knock out all my teeth breathing with his hand on his nose like that Indian god he took me to show one wet Sunday in the museum in Kildare street all yellow in a pinafore lying on his side on his hand with his ten toes sticking out that he said was a bigger religion than the jews and Our Lords both put together all over Asia imitating him as hes always imitating everybody I suppose he used to sleep at the foot of the bed too with his big square feet up in his wifes mouth damn this stinking thing anyway wheres this those napkins are ah yes I know I hope the old press doesnt creak ah I knew it would hes sleeping hard had a good time somewhere still she must have given him great value for his money of course he has to pay for it from her O this nuisance of a thing I hope theyll have something better for us in the other world tying ourselves up God help us thats all right for tonight now the lumpy old jingly bed always reminds me of old Cohen I suppose he scratched himself in it often enough and he thinks father bought it from Lord Napier that I used to admire when I was a little girl because I told him easy piano O I like my bed God here we are as bad as ever after years how many houses were we in at all Raymond terrace and Ontario terrace and Lombard street and Holles street and he goes about whistling every time were on the run again his huguenots or the frogs march pretending to help the men with our sticks of furniture and then the City Arms hotel worse and worse says Warden Daly that charming place on the landing always somebody inside praying then leaving all their stinks after them always know who was in there last every time were just getting on right something happens or he puts his big foot in it Thoms and Helys and Mr Cuffes and Drimmies either hes going to be run into prison over his old lottery tickets that was to be all our salvations or he goes and gives impudence well have him coming home with the sack soon out of the Freeman too like the rest on account of those Sinner Fein or the freemasons then well see if the little man he showed me dribbling along in the wet all by himself round by Coadys lane will give him much consolation that he says is so capable and sincerely Irish he is indeed judging by the sincerity of the trousers I saw on him wait theres Georges church bells wait quarters the hour wait two oclock well thats a nice hour of the night for him to be coming home at to anybody climbing down into the area if anybody saw him Ill knock him off that little habit tomorrow first Ill look at his shirt to see or Ill see if he has that French letter still in his pocketbook I suppose he thinks I dont know deceitful men all their pockets arent enough for their lies then why should we tell them even if its the truth they dont believe you then tucked up in bed like those babies in the Aristocrats Masterpiece he brought me another time as if we hadnt enough of that in real life without some old Aristocrat or whatever his name is disgusting you more with those rotten pictures children with two heads and no legs thats the kind of villainy theyre always dreaming about with not another thing in their empty heads they ought to get slow poison the half of them then tea and toast for him buttered on both sides and newlaid eggs I suppose Im nothing any more when I wouldnt let him lick me in Holles street one night man man tyrant as ever for the one thing he slept on the floor half the night naked the way the jews used when somebody dies belonged to them and wouldnt eat any breakfast or speak a word wanting to be petted so I thought I stood out enough for one time and let him he does it all wrong too thinking only of his own pleasure his tongue is too flat or I dont know what he forgets that wethen I dont Ill make him do it again if he doesnt mind himself and lock him down to sleep in the coalcellar with the blackbeetles I wonder was it her Josie off her head with my castoffs hes such a born liar too no hed never have the courage with a married woman thats why he wants me and Boylan though as for her Denis as she calls him that forlornlooking spectacle you couldnt call him a husband yes its some little bitch hes got in with even when I was with him with Milly at the College races that Hornblower with the childs bonnet on the top of his nob let us into by the back way he was throwing his sheeps eyes at those two doing skirt duty up and down I tried to wink at him first no use of course and thats the way his money goes this is the fruits of Mr Paddy Dignam yes they were all in great style at the grand funeral in the paper Boylan brought in if they saw a real officers funeral thatd be something reversed arms muffled drums the poor horse walking behind in black L Boom and Tom Kernan that drunken little barrelly man that bit his tongue off falling down the mens W C drunk in some place or other and Martin Cunningham and the two Dedaluses and Fanny MCoys husband white head of cabbage skinny thing with a turn in her eye trying to sing my songs shed want to be born all over again and her old green dress with the lowneck as she cant attract them any other way like dabbling on a rainy day I see it all now plainly and they call that friendship killing and then burying one another and they all with their wives and families at home more especially Jack Power keeping that barmaid he does of course his wife is always sick or going to be sick or just getting better of it and hes a goodlooking man still though hes getting a bit grey over the ears theyre a nice lot all of them well theyre not going to get my husband again into their clutches if I can help it making fun of him then behind his back I know well when he goes on with his idiotics because he has sense enough not to squander every penny piece he earns down their gullets and looks after his wife and family goodfornothings poor Paddy Dignam all the same Im sorry in a way for him what are his wife and children going to do unless he was insured comical little teetotum always stuck up in some pub corner and her or her son waiting Bill Bailey wont you please come home her widows weeds wont improve her appearance theyre awfully becoming though if youre goodlooking what men wasnt he yes he was at the Glencree dinner and Ben Dollard base barreltone the night he borrowed the swallowtail to sing out of in Holles street squeezed and squashed into them and grinning all over his big Dolly face like a wellwhipped childs botty didnt he look a balmy ballocks sure enough that must have been a spectacle on the stage imagine paying in the preserved seats for that to see him trotting off in his trowlers and Simon Dedalus too he was always turning up half screwed singing the second verse first the old love is the new was one of his so sweetly sang the maiden on the hawthorn bough he was always on for flirtyfying too when I sang Maritana with him at Freddy Mayers private opera he had a delicious glorious voice Phoebe dearest goodbye sweetheart he always sang it not like Bartell DArcy sweet goodbye of course he had the gift of the voice so there was no art in it all over you like a warm showerbath O Maritana wildwood flower we sang splendidly though it was a bit too high for my register even transposed and he was married at the time to May Goulding but then hed say or do something to knock the good out of it hes a widower now I wonder what sort is his son he says hes an author and going to be a university professor of Italian and Im to take lessons what is he driving at now showing him my photo its not good of me I ought to have got it taken in drapery that never looks out of fashion still I look young in it I wonder he didnt make him a present of it altogether and me too after all why not I saw him driving down to the Kingsbridge station with his father and mother I was in mourning thats years ago now yes hed be though what was the good in going into mourning for what was neither one thing nor the other the first cry was enough for me I heard the deathwatch too ticking in the wall of course he insisted hed go into mourning for the cat I suppose hes a man now by this time he was an innocent boy then and a darling little fellow in his lord Fauntleroy suit and curly hair like a prince on the stage when I saw him at Mat Dillons he liked me too I remember they all do wait by God yes wait yes hold on he was on the cards this morning when I laid out the deck union with a young stranger neither dark nor fair you met before I thought it meant him but hes no chicken nor a stranger either besides my face was turned the other way what was the th card after that the of spades for a journey by land then there was a letter on its way and scandals too the queens and the of diamonds for a rise in society yes wait it all came out and red s for new garments look at that and didnt I dream something too yes there was something about poetry in it I hope he hasnt long greasy hair hanging into his eyes or standing up like a red Indian what do they go about like that for only getting themselves and their poetry laughed at I always liked poetry when I was a girl first I thought he was a poet like lord Byron and not an ounce of it in his composition I thought he was quite different I wonder is he too young hes about wait I was married Milly is yesterday what age was he then at Dillons or about I suppose hes or more Im not too old for him if hes or I hope hes not that stuckup university student sort no otherwise he wouldnt go sitting down in the old kitchen with him taking Eppss cocoa and talking of course he pretended to understand it all probably he told him he was out of Trinity college hes very young to be a professor I hope hes not a professor like Goodwin was he was a potent professor of John Jameson they all write about some woman in their poetry well I suppose he wont find many like me where softly sighs of love the light guitar where poetry is in the air the blue sea and the moon shining so beautifully coming back on the nightboat from Tarifa the lighthouse at Europa point the guitar that fellow played was so expressive will I ever go back there again all new faces two glancing eyes a lattice hid Ill sing that for him theyre my eyes if hes anything of a poet two eyes as darkly bright as loves own star arent those beautiful words as loves young star itll be a change the Lord knows to have an intelligent person to talk to about yourself not always listening to him and Billy Prescotts ad and Keyess ad and Tom the Devils ad then if anything goes wrong in their business we have to suffer Im sure hes very distinguished Id like to meet a man like that God not those other ruck besides hes young those fine young men I could see down in Margate strand bathingplace from the side of the rock standing up in the sun naked like a God or something and then plunging into the sea with them why arent all men like that thered be some consolation for a woman like that lovely little statue he bought I could look at him all day long curly head and his shoulders his finger up for you to listen theres real beauty and poetry for you I often felt I wanted to kiss him all over also his lovely young cock there so simple I wouldnt mind taking him in my mouth if nobody was looking as if it was asking you to suck it so clean and white he looks with his boyish face I would too in a minute even if some of it went down what its only like gruel or the dew theres no danger besides hed be so clean compared with those pigs of men I suppose never dream of washing it from years end to the other the most of them only thats what gives the women the moustaches Im sure itll be grand if I can only get in with a handsome young poet at my age Ill throw them the st thing in the morning till I see if the wishcard comes out or Ill try pairing the lady herself and see if he comes out Ill read and study all I can find or learn a bit off by heart if I knew who he likes so he wont think me stupid if he thinks all women are the same and I can teach him the other part Ill make him feel all over him till he half faints under me then hell write about me lover and mistress publicly too with our photographs in all the papers when he becomes famous O but then what am I going to do about him though no thats no way for him has he no manners nor no refinement nor no nothing in his nature slapping us behind like that on my bottom because I didnt call him Hugh the ignoramus that doesnt know poetry from a cabbage thats what you get for not keeping them in their proper place pulling off his shoes and trousers there on the chair before me so barefaced without even asking permission and standing out that vulgar way in the half of a shirt they wear to be admired like a priest or a butcher or those old hypocrites in the time of Julius Caesar of course hes right enough in his way to pass the time as a joke sure you might as well be in bed with what with a lion God Im sure hed have something better to say for himself an old Lion would O well I suppose its because they were so plump and tempting in my short petticoat he couldnt resist they excite myself sometimes its well for men all the amount of pleasure they get off a womans body were so round and white for them always I wished I was one myself for a change just to try with that thing they have swelling up on you so hard and at the same time so soft when you touch it my uncle John has a thing long I heard those cornerboys saying passing the comer of Marrowbone lane my aunt Mary has a thing hairy because it was dark and they knew a girl was passing it didnt make me blush why should it either its only nature and he puts his thing long into my aunt Marys hairy etcetera and turns out to be you put the handle in a sweepingbrush men again all over they can pick and choose what they please a married woman or a fast widow or a girl for their different tastes like those houses round behind Irish street no but were to be always chained up theyre not going to be chaining me up no damn fear once I start I tell you for their stupid husbands jealousy why cant we all remain friends over it instead of quarrelling her husband found it out what they did together well naturally and if he did can he undo it hes coronado anyway whatever he does and then he going to the other mad extreme about the wife in Fair Tyrants of course the man never even casts a nd thought on the husband or wife either its the woman he wants and he gets her what else were we given all those desires for Id like to know I cant help it if Im young still can I its a wonder Im not an old shrivelled hag before my time living with him so cold never embracing me except sometimes when hes asleep the wrong end of me not knowing I suppose who he has any man thatd kiss a womans bottom Id throw my hat at him after that hed kiss anything unnatural where we havent atom of any kind of expression in us all of us the same lumps of lard before ever Id do that to a man pfooh the dirty brutes the mere thought is enough I kiss the feet of you senorita theres some sense in that didnt he kiss our halldoor yes he did what a madman nobody understands his cracked ideas but me still of course a woman wants to be embraced times a day almost to make her look young no matter by who so long as to be in love or loved by somebody if the fellow you want isnt there sometimes by the Lord God I was thinking would I go around by the quays there some dark evening where nobodyd know me and pick up a sailor off the sea thatd be hot on for it and not care a pin whose I was only do it off up in a gate somewhere or one of those wildlooking gipsies in Rathfarnham had their camp pitched near the Bloomfield laundry to try and steal our things if they could I only sent mine there a few times for the name model laundry sending me back over and over some old ones odd stockings that blackguardlooking fellow with the fine eyes peeling a switch attack me in the dark and ride me up against the wall without a word or a murderer anybody what they do themselves the fine gentlemen in their silk hats that K C lives up somewhere this way coming out of Hardwicke lane the night he gave us the fish supper on account of winning over the boxing match of course it was for me he gave it I knew him by his gaiters and the walk and when I turned round a minute after just to see there was a woman after coming out of it too some filthy prostitute then he goes home to his wife after that only I suppose the half of those sailors are rotten again with disease O move over your big carcass out of that for the love of Mike listen to him the winds that waft my sighs to thee so well he may sleep and sigh the great Suggester Don Poldo de la Flora if he knew how he came out on the cards this morning hed have something to sigh for a dark man in some perplexity between s too in prison for Lord knows what he does that I dont know and Im to be slooching around down in the kitchen to get his lordship his breakfast while hes rolled up like a mummy will I indeed did you ever see me running Id just like to see myself at it show them attention and they treat you like dirt I dont care what anybody says itd be much better for the world to be governed by the women in it you wouldnt see women going and killing one another and slaughtering when do you ever see women rolling around drunk like they do or gambling every penny they have and losing it on horses yes because a woman whatever she does she knows where to stop sure they wouldnt be in the world at all only for us they dont know what it is to be a woman and a mother how could they where would they all of them be if they hadnt all a mother to look after them what I never had thats why I suppose hes running wild now out at night away from his books and studies and not living at home on account of the usual rowy house I suppose well its a poor case that those that have a fine son like that theyre not satisfied and I none was he not able to make one it wasnt my fault we came together when I was watching the two dogs up in her behind in the middle of the naked street that disheartened me altogether I suppose I oughtnt to have buried him in that little woolly jacket I knitted crying as I was but give it to some poor child but I knew well Id never have another our st death too it was we were never the same since O Im not going to think myself into the glooms about that any more I wonder why he wouldnt stay the night I felt all the time it was somebody strange he brought in instead of roving around the city meeting God knows who nightwalkers and pickpockets his poor mother wouldnt like that if she was alive ruining himself for life perhaps still its a lovely hour so silent I used to love coming home after dances the air of the night they have friends they can talk to weve none either he wants what he wont get or its some woman ready to stick her knife in you I hate that in women no wonder they treat us the way they do we are a dreadful lot of bitches I suppose its all the troubles we have makes us so snappy Im not like that he could easy have slept in there on the sofa in the other room I suppose he was as shy as a boy he being so young hardly of me in the next room hed have heard me on the chamber arrah what harm Dedalus I wonder its like those names in Gibraltar Delapaz Delagracia they had the devils queer names there father Vilaplana of Santa Maria that gave me the rosary Rosales y OReilly in the Calle las Siete Revueltas and Pisimbo and Mrs Opisso in Governor street O what a name Id go and drown myself in the first river if I had a name like her O my and all the bits of streets Paradise ramp and Bedlam ramp and Rodgers ramp and Crutchetts ramp and the devils gap steps well small blame to me if I am a harumscarum I know I am a bit I declare to God I dont feel a day older than then I wonder could I get my tongue round any of the Spanish como esta usted muy bien gracias y usted see I havent forgotten it all I thought I had only for the grammar a noun is the name of any person place or thing pity I never tried to read that novel cantankerous Mrs Rubio lent me by Valera with the questions in it all upside down the two ways I always knew wed go away in the end I can tell him the Spanish and he tell me the Italian then hell see Im not so ignorant what a pity he didnt stay Im sure the poor fellow was dead tired and wanted a good sleep badly I could have brought him in his breakfast in bed with a bit of toast so long as I didnt do it on the knife for bad luck or if the woman was going her rounds with the watercress and something nice and tasty there are a few olives in the kitchen he might like I never could bear the look of them in Abrines I could do the criada the room looks all right since I changed it the other way you see something was telling me all the time Id have to introduce myself not knowing me from Adam very funny wouldnt it Im his wife or pretend we were in Spain with him half awake without a Gods notion where he is dos huevos estrellados senor Lord the cracked things come into my head sometimes itd be great fun supposing he stayed with us why not theres the room upstairs empty and Millys bed in the back room he could do his writing and studies at the table in there for all the scribbling he does at it and if he wants to read in bed in the morning like me as hes making the breakfast for he can make it for Im sure Im not going to take in lodgers off the street for him if he takes a gesabo of a house like this Id love to have a long talk with an intelligent welleducated person Id have to get a nice pair of red slippers like those Turks with the fez used to sell or yellow and a nice semitransparent morning gown that I badly want or a peachblossom dressing jacket like the one long ago in Walpoles only or Ill just give him one more chance Ill get up early in the morning Im sick of Cohens old bed in any case I might go over to the markets to see all the vegetables and cabbages and tomatoes and carrots and all kinds of splendid fruits all coming in lovely and fresh who knows whod be the st man Id meet theyre out looking for it in the morning Mamy Dillon used to say they are and the night too that was her massgoing Id love a big juicy pear now to melt in your mouth like when I used to be in the longing way then Ill throw him up his eggs and tea in the moustachecup she gave him to make his mouth bigger I suppose hed like my nice cream too I know what Ill do Ill go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then mi fa pieta Masetto then Ill start dressing myself to go out presto non son piu forte Ill put on my best shift and drawers let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him Ill let him know if thats what he wanted that his wife is fucked yes and damn well fucked too up to my neck nearly not by him or times handrunning theres the mark of his spunk on the clean sheet I wouldnt bother to even iron it out that ought to satisfy him if you dont believe me feel my belly unless I made him stand there and put him into me Ive a mind to tell him every scrap and make him do it out in front of me serve him right its all his own fault if I am an adulteress as the thing in the gallery said O much about it if thats all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears God knows its not much doesnt everybody only they hide it I suppose thats what a woman is supposed to be there for or He wouldnt have made us the way He did so attractive to men then if he wants to kiss my bottom Ill drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life he can stick his tongue miles up my hole as hes there my brown part then Ill tell him I want or perhaps Ill tell him I want to buy underclothes then if he gives me that well he wont be too bad I dont want to soak it all out of him like other women do I could often have written out a fine cheque for myself and write his name on it for a couple of pounds a few times he forgot to lock it up besides he wont spend it Ill let him do it off on me behind provided he doesnt smear all my good drawers O I suppose that cant be helped Ill do the indifferent or questions Ill know by the answers when hes like that he cant keep a thing back I know every turn in him Ill tighten my bottom well and let out a few smutty words smellrump or lick my shit or the first mad thing comes into my head then Ill suggest about yes O wait now sonny my turn is coming Ill be quite gay and friendly over it O but I was forgetting this bloody pest of a thing pfooh you wouldnt know which to laugh or cry were such a mixture of plum and apple no Ill have to wear the old things so much the better itll be more pointed hell never know whether he did it or not there thats good enough for you any old thing at all then Ill wipe him off me just like a business his omission then Ill go out Ill have him eying up at the ceiling where is she gone now make him want me thats the only way a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office or the alarmclock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze off what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so as I can get up early Ill go to Lambes there beside Findlaters and get them to send us some flowers to put about the place in case he brings him home tomorrow today I mean no no Fridays an unlucky day first I want to do the place up someway the dust grows in it I think while Im asleep then we can have music and cigarettes I can accompany him first I must clean the keys of the piano with milk whatll I wear shall I wear a white rose or those fairy cakes in Liptons I love the smell of a rich big shop at d a lb or the other ones with the cherries in them and the pinky sugar d a couple of lbs of those a nice plant for the middle of the table Id get that cheaper in wait wheres this I saw them not long ago I love flowers Id love to have the whole place swimming in roses God of heaven theres nothing like nature the wild mountains then the sea and the waves rushing then the beautiful country with the fields of oats and wheat and all kinds of things and all the fine cattle going about that would do your heart good to see rivers and lakes and flowers all sorts of shapes and smells and colours springing up even out of the ditches primroses and violets nature it is as for them saying theres no God I wouldnt give a snap of my two fingers for all their learning why dont they go and create something I often asked him atheists or whatever they call themselves go and wash the cobbles off themselves first then they go howling for the priest and they dying and why why because theyre afraid of hell on account of their bad conscience ah yes I know them well who was the first person in the universe before there was anybody that made it all who ah that they dont know neither do I so there you are they might as well try to stop the sun from rising tomorrow the sun shines for you he said the day we were lying among the rhododendrons on Howth head in the grey tweed suit and his straw hat the day I got him to propose to me yes first I gave him the bit of seedcake out of my mouth and it was leapyear like now yes years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said I was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all a womans body yes that was one true thing he said in his life and the sun shines for you today yes that was why I liked him because I saw he understood or felt what a woman is and I knew I could always get round him and I gave him all the pleasure I could leading him on till he asked me to say yes and I wouldnt answer first only looked out over the sea and the sky I was thinking of so many things he didnt know of Mulvey and Mr Stanhope and Hester and father and old captain Groves and the sailors playing all birds fly and I say stoop and washing up dishes they called it on the pier and the sentry in front of the governors house with the thing round his white helmet poor devil half roasted and the Spanish girls laughing in their shawls and their tall combs and the auctions in the morning the Greeks and the jews and the Arabs and the devil knows who else from all the ends of Europe and Duke street and the fowl market all clucking outside Larby Sharons and the poor donkeys slipping half asleep and the vague fellows in the cloaks asleep in the shade on the steps and the big wheels of the carts of the bulls and the old castle thousands of years old yes and those handsome Moors all in white and turbans like kings asking you to sit down in their little bit of a shop and Ronda with the old windows of the posadas glancing eyes a lattice hid for her lover to kiss the iron and the wineshops half open at night and the castanets and the night we missed the boat at Algeciras the watchman going about serene with his lamp and O that awful deepdown torrent O and the sea the sea crimson sometimes like fire and the glorious sunsets and the figtrees in the Alameda gardens yes and all the queer little streets and the pink and blue and yellow houses and the rosegardens and the jessamine and geraniums and cactuses and Gibraltar as a girl where I was a Flower of the mountain yes when I put the rose in my hair like the Andalusian girls used or shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes	1.0090187662559849
